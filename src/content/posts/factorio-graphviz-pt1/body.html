  Graphviz is a software that renders graphs, Factorio is a game in which you
  build and maintain factories; let's explore how both can complement each
  other.
</p>

<aside class="note">
  <p>
    I assume you know a bit about Factorio and, as for the rest of concepts,
    I'll introduce you to them as we go. If you haven't played Factorio yet, I
    highly encourage you to give it a try!

  The story goes: we've started the game, built a few mining drills
  (particularly for coal, iron, and copper), and got a basic electrical grid set
  up - <b>time for science!</b>
</p>

<p>Certainly, we need a handful of laboratories:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="{{ assets }}/factorio-laboratories.jpg" />
</figure>

<p>
  For our laboratories to work, we need a production line that will provide a
  constant flow of science packs; since automation science packs are turbo-easy
  to produce, let's ignore them and focus right-away on
  <a href="https://wiki.factorio.com/Logistic_science_pack"
    >logistic science packs</a
  >.
</p>

<p>As we can find on Factorio's Wiki:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      To produce <code>1 logistic science pack</code>, we'll need
      <code>1 inserter</code> and <code>1 transport belt</code>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Before though, to produce that <code>1 inserter</code>, we'll need
      <code>1 electronic circuit</code>, <code>1 iron gear wheel</code>, and
      <code>1 iron plate</code>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Before though, to produce <i>that</i> <code>1 electronic circuit</code>,
      we'll need…​ well, describing this in English gets tedious; what do you
      say we invent some notation to make the our recipe just a tad more
      legible?
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Let's start with a minimalistic textual format of:</p>

<listing>
  <!--
    product
        requirements
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  <i
    >Oh, thinking about all the stuff we can do with this grammar-boi gives me
    shivers running down my spine!</i
  >
</p>

<p>Translating the former ingredients, we get:</p>

<listing>
  <!--
    logistic_science_pack
        inserter
        transport_belt
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  Since both <code>inserter</code> and <code>transport_belt</code> need to be
  produced too, let's include them as well:
</p>

<listing>
  <!--
    logistic_science_pack
        inserter
        transport_belt
    
    inserter
        electronic_circuit
        iron_gear_wheel
        iron_plate
    
    transport_belt
        iron_gear_wheel
        iron_plate
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  Similarly, we'll need to produce <code>electronic_circuit</code>,
  <code>iron_gear_wheel</code>, and - generally - everything that's not
  primitive (which in my case means that I'll need to produce everything up to
  <code>iron_plate</code> and <code>copper_plate</code>):
</p>

    Some people like to build
    <a href="https://wiki.factorio.com/Tutorial:Main_bus">main buses</a> with
    different constituents - if you have an abundance of e.g. iron gear wheels,
    feel free to skip them from the recipe.
  </p>
</aside>

<p>This was the first step.</p>

<p>
  So far, we've gathered all the knowledge about what needs to be fetched
  (think: copper plates) and what needs to be built (think: iron gear wheels) -
  our original problem remains open though:
  <b>where to place those assembly machines?</b>
</p>

<p>That's when graphs come into play.</p>

<h2 id="_introduction_to_graphs">
  <a href="#_introduction_to_graphs">Introduction to graphs</a>
</h2>

<p>
  Graphs are structures used to model <b>relationships</b> between objects -
  using graphs you can represent things like family trees or networks of
  friends:
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="{{ assets }}/graph-1.svg"/>
</figure>

<p>
  Graphs consist of <b>nodes</b> (<code>Patryk</code>, <code>Dafne</code> etc.
  on the image above) and <b>edges</b> (the lines connecting nodes).
</p>

<p>Graphs can be <b>undirected</b> (like the one above) or <b>directed</b>:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="{{ assets }}/graph-2.svg"/>
</figure>

<p>
  Graphs can be <b>rendered by computers</b> (like the one above) or, obviously,
  <b>by hand</b>:
</p>

<figure class="w-40">
  <img src="{{ assets }}/hand-drawn-graph.svg" />
</figure>

<p>
  Since this post is all about automating stuff, we're going to focus solely on
  the computer-generated graphs - using
  <a href="https://www.graphviz.org">Graphviz</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Graphviz is a software that transforms description of a graph (written in the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)"
    >DOT language</a
  >) into an image; for instance, here's source code of the directed graph you
  saw above:
</p>

<listing lang="dot">
  <!--
    # This instruction starts a directed graph
    digraph {
        # This instruction makes the graph go left-to-right
        rankdir = "LR"
    
        # Those instructions define nodes and edges ("connections")
        Patryk -> Dafne
        Dafne -> Patryk
        Dafne -> Niko
        Dafne -> Dulcia
        Dulcia -> Charlie
    }
  -->
</listing>

<aside class="note">
  <p>
    There are lots of fantastic <b>online</b> tools you can use to preview
    graphs written in the DOT language; I frequently use
    <a href="https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline"
      >https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline</a
    >
    and
    <a href="https://rsms.me/graphviz/"
      >https://rsms.me/graphviz/</a
    >.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can just open the page, copy & paste graph's code and get a nice image
    in return.
  </p>
</aside>

<p>
  What's peculiar about the DOT language, and what we're going to exploit in a
  second, is the fact that we don't have to specify <b>where</b> our nodes and
  edges should be located - we just say <code>Patryk → Dafne</code>,
  <code>Dafne → Niko</code> and the program, almost magically,
  <b>lays out</b> everything for us in an aesthetically-pleasant way.
</p>

<p>
  Let's see how we can use this feature to answer the problem we had in the
  previous section.
</p>

<aside class="note">
  <p>
    The overall subject of pretty-printing graphs is called
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing"

    - it's a nice rabbit hole to go down for a side programming project!

<p>Let's recall our recipe:</p>

<listing>
  <!--

        inserter
        transport_belt
    
    inserter

<p>
  Since Graphviz doesn't understand our notation (we've just invented it,
  right?), first we have to translate it into the DOT language.
</p>

<p>Let's start with <code>logistic_science_pack</code>:</p>

<div class="col-graph">

<p>
  Neat, we've finally extracted some <i>new</i> information from the system:
  <b>placement</b> and <b>wiring</b>!
</p>

<p>
  Granted, it's not perfect (fat chance those curvy transport belts would
  actually work in the game), but it's a nice starting point - now let's try to
  improve it.
</p>

<p>
  Since transport belts must be straight, let's start by forcing the edges to be
  in line via <code>splines = ortho</code>:

<p>It looks somewhat better, but still kinda sloppy.</p>

<p>
  Since in my factory I'm going to transport copper plates next to iron plates,
  it will be helpful to align
  <code>copper_plate</code> on the same level as <code>iron_plate</code> (since
  both will effectively function as "inputs" to our module).
</p>

<p>To align nodes, we can use the <code>rank</code> instruction:</p>

<p>
  Well, our new layout is both technically correct and a bit disappointing -
  even though we've managed to get <code>copper_plate</code> and
  <code>iron_plate</code> on the same level, we've also ended up with two
  crossing edges (next to <code>transport_belt</code>), which is a no-go for
  such a small module.
</p>

<p>
  Let's help Graphviz by additionally aligning <code>inserter</code> and
  <code>transport_belt</code> on the same level:

  Not sure about you, but I am <b>in awe</b> seeing how well Graphviz managed to
  lay our graph out - we could reconstruct it almost 1:1 in the game!
</p>

<p>There's just one itsy-bitsy tiny thing we may still iterate on:</p>

<p>Do you see that <code>iron_gear_wheel</code> near the centre?</p>

<p>
  Currently it's responsible for producing wheels both for
  <code>transport_belt</code> and <code>inserter</code>, which means we'd have
  to apply a splitter - this seems overly troublesome by my standards, so let's
  just create two separate assembly machines instead:

  The first potion gets produced at 0:25, which is a rather long time, but -
  even so - <b>it's a success</b>!
</p>

<p>Now, there's a vast array of things we could still work on - mainly:</p>

<p>
  Up to this point we didn't really care about <i>how long</i> it takes to
  produce each part - and so at 0:33 we can see that everything gets
  bottle-necked at the final, <code>logistic_science_pack</code> assembly
  machine.

<p>Solving this issue is left as an exercise for the reader :-)</p>

  Now, since I don't enjoy arduous, repetitive tasks, I've prepared a tiny
  application that can do the graphing for me:

<p>As with everything, so doesn't using Graphviz solve all our problems.</p>

<p>
  I find it helpful in planning the <b>initial sketches</b> of various modules
  (which I later reiterate on a piece of paper before eventually reconstructing
  in Factorio), and that's why I wanted to share this method with you.
