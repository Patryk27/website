  Every now and then one has to index something - in my case it was prices. Lots
  of them. At my previous job we've had this custom engine that basically loaded
  tons of data points:
</p>

<listing>
  <!--
  |  city  |          dates         |  room  | occupancy |     price      |

  | warsaw | 2018-01-15..2018-01-31 | double | 1 adult   | 125.00 per day |

  | warsaw | 2018-01-01..2018-01-14 | double | 2 adults  | 175.00 per day |
  | warsaw | 2018-01-15..2018-01-14 | double | 2 adults  | 200.00 per day |

  | berlin | 2018-01-01..2018-01-14 | double | 1 adult   | 160.00 per day |
  | berlin | 2018-01-15..2018-01-31 | double | 1 adult   | 185.00 per day |

  | berlin | 2018-01-01..2018-01-14 | double | 2 adults  | 235.00 per day |
  | berlin | 2018-01-15..2018-01-14 | double | 2 adults  | 260.00 per day |
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  ... and then it allowed you to issue queries, like:
</p>

<listing>
  <!--
  find me the cheapest stay in berlin for 2 adults, from 2018-01-03 to 2018-01-04, plzz
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  Calculating prices was plenty difficult on its own, since you had to take into
  account supplements, discounts, taxes, cancellation policies etc., lots of
  things that don't really reduce the problem to a simple hashmap lookup. But
  the actually interesting thing happened <i>earlier</i>.
</p>

<p>
  After all, before we're able to calculate prices, we have to find them.

<p>
  Let's ground ourselves with a specific example - we're given all of those:
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
  use std::collections::HashMap;
  use std::ops::RangeInclusive;

  type City = String;
  type CityRef<'a> = &'a str;
  type RoomRef<'a> = &'a str;

  #[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord, Hash)]
  struct Date {
      day: u32, // e.g. days since 1970-01-01
  }

  #[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]
  struct Occupancy {
      adults: u8,
  }

  #[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq)]
  struct Price<'a> {
      city: CityRef<'a>,
      dates: RangeInclusive<Date>,
      room: RoomRef<'a>,
      occ: Occupancy,
      price: f32, // ofc. one wouldn't actually use float for money
  }

  #[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq)]
  struct Query<'a> {
      city: CityRef<'a>,
      dates: RangeInclusive<Date>,
      occ: Occupancy,
  }
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  ... and our problem is to efficiently implement this function:
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
  fn query(prices: &[Price], query: &Query) -> Option<f32>
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  Naively, we're looking for:
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
  fn query(prices: &[Price], query: &Query) -> Option<f32> {
      prices
          .iter()
          .filter(|price| {
              price.city == query.city
                  && price.dates.start() <= query.dates.start()
                  && price.dates.end() >= query.dates.end()
                  && price.occ == query.occ
          })
          .map(|price| price.price)
          .next()
  }
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  ... but, of course, that won't fly when we're given millions of prices.
</p>

<p class="text-dim">
  (also, ideally we'd find the cheapest price, but for the sake of example let's
  say that finding <i>any</i> price will do)

  Faced with this problem, one might take a deep S3 sleep first, then wake up,
  drink a cup of coffee laced with kava kava and finally spit:

<p>
  ... and that's a perfectly valid approach! Although...
</p>

<note>
  <p>
    Note that I'm proposing <code>Vec&lt;usize&gt;</code> instead of
    <code>Vec&lt;&Price&gt;</code> - why is that?
  </p>

  <p>
    If we were to implement the rest of the application, we'd probably end up
    with something like:
  </p>

  <listing lang="rust">
    <!--
    struct Engine {
        prices: Vec<Price>,
        index: Index,
    }
    -->
  </listing>

  <p>
    Now, if our <code>Index</code> was based around borrows:
  </p>

  <listing lang="rust">
    <!--
    struct Index<'a> {
        indexed_prices: HashMap<City, HashMap<Occupancy, Vec<&'a Price>>>,
    }
    -->
  </listing>

  <p>
    ... then we'd have to implement a self-referential <code>Engine</code>:
  </p>

  <listing lang="rust">
    <!--
    struct Engine {
        prices: Vec<Price>,
        index: Index<'whoopsie>,
    }
    -->
  </listing>

  <p>
    ... and self-referential types are not really supported in Rust - the
    language is actively hostile to you if you try to use them, and so I'm
    proposing we go with <code>Vec&lt;usize&gt;</code> from day zero.
  </p>

  <p>
    Also, it'll just come handy later, pinky promise, just trust me.
  </p>
</note>

<h2 id="unwasting">

<p>
  Alright, look at them <code>Vec&lt;usize&gt;</code>. Look. At. Them. Squeeze
  your eyes. Unsqueeze them. Do a squat. Do you see what I see?
</p>

<p class="text-bold">
  Those vectors are mostly filled with zeros!
</p>

<p>
  On a 64-bit machine, one <code>usize</code> weighs 8 bytes and allows to
  encode numbers from 0 up to 2^64-1.
</p>

<p>
  18446744073709551615 - man that's <i>a lot</i> of prices! A lot. It's so many,
  in fact, that we would run out of memory (let alone time) before we're able to
  index half of them. One tenth. One percent. We're given all this space that we
  cannot reasonably use.
</p>

<p>
  This is something that I noticed back then as well, pretty much accidentally
  by just looking around the code looking for links to memes.
</p>

<p>
  <i>"But, surely it's not mu..."</i>, you might say before I gag you.
  Gigabytes. Praires full of zeros -- and, in this economy!
</p>

<p>
  To fix this, I've come up with a vector specialized for handling lists of
  indices - it starts as <code>Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code> and upgrades itself to a
  larger variant (<code>Vec&lt;u16&gt;</code> or <code>Vec&lt;u32&gt;</code>)
  when you push a number large enough.
</p>

<p>
  It goes sorta like:
</p>

  Summary
</h2>

<p>
  Should you (continue to) use <code>Vec&lt;usize&gt;</code>? Most likely yes!
</p>

<p>
  This <code>IndexVec</code> has a couple of performance/memory trade-offs -
  especially around building it - that don't warrant using it as a generic
  replacement for <code>Vec&lt;usize&gt;</code>. But it does come handy
  sometimes. But there's nothing wrong with usizes. But they can be too much.
  You know, life. Choices. Stuff.
</p>

<p>
  It would be nice to probably publish this vector as a crate - I haven't found
  anything like this on crates.io yet; rustc has a similarly named struct, but
  it does something else.
</p>

  Anyway, ♪ memory for nothing and bits for free... ♪
