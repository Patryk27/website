<p>
  In this series we'll create a simulation of <b>evolution</b> using
  <b>neural network</b> and <b>genetic algorithm</b>.
</p>

<p>
  I'm going to introduce you to how a basic neural network and genetic algorithm
  works, then we'll implement both in <b>Rust</b> and compile our application to
  <b>WebAssembly</b>.
