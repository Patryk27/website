  kartoffels is a game where you're given a potato and your job is to implement
  a firmware for it:

  Today I've released v0.7, which spans 122 commits and brings:

<h2 id="worldgen">
  Cellular Automata Worldgen
</h2>

  Rooms are nice. I like rooms. Who doesn't like a room or two? They remind me
  of my <a>favourite movie</a>, they are great. Anyway, at least that's what I
  thought when I started implementing kartoffels:

  <ref>
    https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php/Cellular_Automata_Method_for_Generating_Random_Cave-Like_Levels
  </ref>

  Everything changed when <s>the Fire Nation atta</s> I learned that you can use
  <a>white noise paired with cellular automata</a> to generate some real
  nice-looking caves. Real. Nice.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="{{ assets }}/worldgen-cave.png" />
</figure>

<p>
  Here's the algorithm in live action. Seeing CA generate plausibly looking
  caves out of pure noise is purely amazing:

  </ref>

  <a>My algorithm</a> mostly follows recommendations given by roguebasin.com,
  with the only major difference being in handling isolated caves.
</p>

<p>
  You see, this entire algorithm is prone to creating disconnected parts of the
  map:

  </ref>

  This is problematic, because kartoffels can't drill (and implementing drilling
  mechanic would come with its own bag of problems...), so a robot with a bad
  luck would just get spawned into one of those tiny caves and avoid all of the
  <a>Fun</a>.
</p>

<p>
  There are a couple of solutions to this problem - some smarter, some... not so
  much. You could, for instance, join all the sub-caves together into a larger
  cave system, possibly using Langton's Ant to make the corridors looks more
  natural.
</p>

<p>
  I have tried that, I have failed - brute force now is my name.
</p>

  (to be specific - I couldn't get the corridors to look nice, you could always
  see something's off there)

  My current approach simply <a ref="1">discovers</a> all caves on the map using
  flood fill and then fills all caves except the largest one with stone. If
  after this operation map ends up containing <a ref="2">less than 50% of
  stone</a>, it is rejected and the worldgen is <a ref="3">repeated</a> on
  another seed.
</p>

<p>
  To avoid being a frustrating experience for the players ("<i>did the entire
  map just reset ???</i>"), all of this actually happens before the animation -
  by the time the map is presented, we already know that its seed is golden.
</p>

<h2 id="statistics">
  Statistics
</h2>

<p>
  Following the example of Google, Amazon, and a couple of other companies, the
  engine now intimately tracks the history of each bot - recording every birth,
  death, movement, and stab:

<p>
  There are no world-wide leaderboards yet, but the data is being recorded - I'm
  hoping to implement things like "what was the best bot in the previous 24h" in
  the next version.
</p>

<h2 id="riscv">
  32-bit RISC-V
</h2>

<p>
  <ref>
    https://github.com/Patryk27/kartoffels/tree/df846d089c68c22683fe44e4dd687b26e46036f5/app/crates/kartoffels-cpu
  </ref>

  Each kartoffel is equipped with an arm, compass, motor, radar, serial port,
  and - of course - <a>a CPU!</a>
</p>

<p>
  <ref>
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V
  </ref>

  Up until this version, the game emulated the 64-bit <a>RISC-V</a> architecture
  (aka RV64) and this version changes it to the 32-bit one (aka RV32). There's a
  couple of reasons behind this:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Each bot has only 128 kB of RAM, so there's no point in providing a 64-bit
      address space.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      RV64 has more instructions, making it the more difficult variant to
      emulate.
    </p>

    <p>
      In particular there's a lot of instructions such as "do this, but in
      32-bits" (e.g. <code>addiw</code>) that you simply don't have to implement
      otherwise.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Binaries compiled for RV64 are larger.
    </p>

    <p>
      <ref>
        https://github.com/Patryk27/kartoffels/blob/df846d089c68c22683fe44e4dd687b26e46036f5/app/crates/kartoffels-prefabs/src/chl-personal-roomba.rs#L1
      </ref>

      This of course depends on what your program (firmware) actually does, but
      <a>the heaviest bot I have</a> weighs 59 kB compiled for RV64 and just 50
      kB compiled for RV32. It might not seem like a lot, but since the
      firmware's size counts towards RAM usage, and you're given 128 kB for
      everything, every kilobyte counts.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

  Unfortunately, especially paired with the worldgen change, this has forced me
  to reset the server, wiping all the bots uploaded so far. Let me honor the
  memory of some of the souls that perished:

<h2 id="ui">
  Interface changes
</h2>

<p>
  Next to all the new goodies, a couple of already existing windows and widgets
  got redesigned - in particular the <code>bots</code> dialog can now be fully
  operated using just the keyboard:

<h2 id="other-things">
  Other things
</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Bots can now <span class="text-rainbow">move backward</span>.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Couple of cooldowns got changed, especially around motors.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      API documentation got reworked to be more thorough.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>

      </ref>

      Engine got reworked to use <code>bevy_ecs</code>, viva la
      <a>schedulation</a>.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      If you don't want to or can't play the online version, you can now build
      and run kartoffels locally. This has always been supported, it's just that
      now the instructions (n.b. rather straightforward, since it's just a Rust
      project) are written down in README.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Anyway, <a href="https://kartoffels.pwy.io">come and play!</a>
  (or <code>ssh kartoffels.pwy.io</code>)
