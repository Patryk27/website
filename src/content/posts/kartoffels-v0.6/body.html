<p>
  kartoffels is a game where you're given a potato and your job is to implement
  a firmware for it:

  Today I'm releasing v0.6, which spans 120 commits and brings:
</p>

<h2 id="new-challenges">
  New challenges
</h2>

<p>
  kartoffels strives to be both a multiplayer and a singleplayer game - to
  achieve that, the game provides challenges where you're tasked with
  implementing a robot that solves a specific problem, kinda like Advent of Code
  or Project Euler.
</p>

<p>
  This version brings two new challenges, <code>diamond-heist</code> and
  <code>personal-roomba</code>:
</p>

</figure>

<p>
  I think <code>personal-roomba</code> is my favorite challenge so far - you're
  thrown into a randomly generated maze (with cycles!) and your job is to
  implement a robot that scans the territory and collects all four flags located
  at the maze's corners:

  It's a perfect opportunity to play with <a ref>Dijkstra</a>, CPU and memory
  optimizations, and what have you.

<h2 id="simplified-radar-functions">
  Simplified radar functions
</h2>

<p>
  Radar allows for a robot to scan its surrounding area, making it a critical
  component to get right for robot to work. In the previous version the
  <code>radar_scan_*</code> functions returned a 2d array containing the entire
  scan:
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    pub fn radar_scan_3x3() -> [[char; 3]; 3];
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  This design proved a bit awkward to use due to its untypical indexing:
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    let scan = radar_scan_3x3();

    // e.g.:
    // scan = [
    //     ['.', '.', '.'],
    //     ['.', '@', '.'],
    //     ['.', '.', '.'],
    // ]
    //
    // ... which gives us:
    //
    // scan[1][1] -> center of the scan (i.e. the robot iself)
    // scan[0][1] -> tile in front of the robot
    // scan[2][1] -> tile behind the robot
    // scan[1][0] -> tile to the left of the robot
    // scan[1][2] -> tile to the right of the robot
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  ... and so the <code>radar_scan_*</code> functions were redesigned to return a
  struct with a convenient accessor:
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    let scan = radar_scan_3x3();

    // scan.at(0, 0)  -> center of the scan (i.e. the robot iself)
    // scan.at(0, -1) -> tile in front of the robot
    // scan.at(0, 1)  -> tile behind the robot
    // scan.at(-1, 0) -> tile to the left of the robot
    // scan.at(1, 0)  -> tile to the right of the robot
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  Seizing the day, the radar got extra data - you can now use it to check which
  specific robot is at given location:
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    if let Some(bot_id) = scan.bot_at(0, -1) {
        if !friends.contains(&bot_id) {
            arm_stab();
        }
    }
  -->
</listing>

<h2 id="arm-pick-and-arm-drop">
  <code>arm_pick()</code> and <code>arm_drop()</code>
</h2>

<p>
  Robots can now pick objects from the ground and drop them.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="{{ assets }}/arm-pick-and-arm-drop.png" />
  <figcaption>A diamond, held captive by four guards.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  Currently this comes handy only for the two new challenges, since objects are
  not spawned in the multiplayer mode (and robots can't create objects out of
  thin air themselves).
</p>

<p>
  I'm thinking of using this feature to introduce a new game mode,
  <b>capture the flag</b>.
</p>

<h2 id="em-dashes">
  Em Dashes
</h2>

<p>
  A friend said it's illegal to use <code>-</code> when I really mean
  <code>—</code> - I've read a bit about it, got anxious, drank coffee, got more
  anxious, and went through all of the texts to <code>s/-/—</code> where
  applicable:
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="{{ assets }}/em-dashes.png" />
  <figcaption>An em dash, held captive by letters and spaces.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  I'm still a bit on the fence on this, mostly because writing <code>—</code> is
  kinda annoying, but I see the merit.
</p>

<h2 id="inspect-bot-command">
  <code>inspect-bot</code> command
</h2>

<p>
  You can now inspect the history of each bot:
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="{{ assets }}/inspect-bot-command.png" />
</figure>

<p>
  Currently the times are always displayed in UTC+0 and you can't search through
  the history, but it still comes handy e.g. to see why your bot is dead (it
  might've gotten killed, the firmware might've crashed etc.).
</p>

<h2 id="smooth-camera-movements">
  Smooth camera movements
</h2>

<p>
  Camera now interpolates between current and target position, making for a
  smoother experience:
</p>

  <video src="{{ assets }}/smooth-camera-movements.webm" />
</figure>

<h2 id="compression">
  Compression
</h2>

<p>
  As it turns out, a text interface can generate <i>a lot</i> of data!
</p>

<p>
  This issue stems mostly from ANSI escape codes, used by kartoffels (and so
  indirectly via Ratatui) to render colorful text, change background colors etc.
</p>

<p>
  For instance, if you'd like for the terminal to print something using an
  arbitrary RGB color of, say, <code>rgb(123, 250, 33)</code>, you'd have to
  send <code>\x1b[38;2;123;250;33m</code> - that's 18 bytes just to change the
  color!
</p>

<p class="text-dim">
  (<code>\x1b</code> is a single byte with hex code <code>0x1b</code> - it's a
  special "character" that informs the terminal that the following bytes encode
  an instruction such as <code>pls change foreground color</code>)
</p>

<p>
  For instance, when the camera is moving, a 125x60 x 30 FPS session generates
  about 0.8 MB/s of traffic. It's nothing for an application running locally,
  but sending 0.8 MB/s over the internet for each session would quickly add up
  on my Hetzner VPS.
</p>

<p>
  To remedy the issue, the backend - both for SSH and WebSockets connections -
  now compresses the frames using the <code>flate2</code> crate before sending
  them out. The CPU impact is minimal, while the network traffic is greatly
  reduced.

  For the next release, I'm planning to continue implementing more challenges -
  I've also got <a ref>!36</a> on my list, gotta give more love to the
  multiplayer mode.
