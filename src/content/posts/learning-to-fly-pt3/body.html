  This is third part of the <b>Learning to Fly</b> series in which we're coding
  a simulation of evolution using <b>neural network</b> and
  <b>genetic algorithm</b>:

  In the previous post, we implemented a rudimentary feed-forward neural network
  that could propagate numbers through its randomized layers - it was the first
  milestone in our effors to create a functioning brain.
</p>

<p>
  Randomness can get us only so far, though - for the most part, evolution is
  about making small, incremental <b>changes</b> to the system, so that it gets
  better over time; so that our brains, from entirely haywire~ish, begin to
  gather knowledge and function as we expect from them (i.e. just catch the
  food, birdies!).
</p>

<p>But how can we <b>train</b> a bunch of <code>Vec&lt;f32&gt;</code>?</p>

<h2 id="plan">
  <a href="#plan">Plan</a>
</h2>

<p>
  Plan for today is straightforward: we'll learn how a genetic algorithm works
  by implementing one in Rust. We'll examine in-depth how
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_(genetic_algorithm)"
    >selection</a
  >,
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(genetic_algorithm)"
    >crossover</a
  >, and
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_(genetic_algorithm)"
    >mutation</a
  >
  all play together, allowing for a computer to find complex answers seemingly
  out of thin air.
</p>

<p>
  We'll try to remain <b>generic</b>, meaning that instead of hard-coding a
  particular selection or crossover algorithm, we'll use
  <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-02-traits.html">traits</a> to
  create a versatile library that could be even published to
  <a href="https://crates.io">crates.io</a>!
</p>

<p>
  As in the previous part, so today we'll investigate various intricacies of
  Rust's syntax, focusing a lot on the terminology.
</p>

<p>
  Hopefully, by the end of this post you'll be able to say: I could have
  implemented it on my own!
</p>

<h2 id="intro">
  <a href="#intro">Introduction</a>
</h2>

<p>
  First, let's recap how does a genetic algorithm work and what's the point of
  this venture.
</p>

<p>
  Our problem is that we've got an object - a neural network - that's defined by
  a whole lot of <b>parameters</b>. There are so many of them that, even for the
  smallest of networks, we couldn't possibly brute-force all of their
  combinations in our lifetime.
</p>

<aside class="note">
  <p>
    As you might remember, all the possible parameters in general are called a
    <b>search space</b>; so an erudite would say that our problem's search space
    is <i>huuuuge</i> and then run away.
  </p>
</aside>

<p>
  What we can do is to kinda <i>mimic</i> the nature: if we started with a bunch
  of random <b>suboptimal</b> solutions, we could try improving them to get -
  over time - gradually better answers.
</p>

<p>
  One of the methods that allows to simulate all this evolutionary machinery is
  the eponymous <b>genetic algorithm</b>: it starts with a bunch of random
  solution-<i>candidates</i> (a <b>population</b>), which are then improved
  using <b>mutation</b> and <b>crossover</b>, utilizing a
  <b>fitness function</b> to evaluate solutions (<b>individuals</b>) found so
  far:
</p>

<figure class="sketch w-80">
  <img src="{{ assets }}/sketches/intro-1.svg" />

  <figcaption>
    <div class="title">
      Overview of the genetic algorithm; starting from top and and going
      clockwise: (1) estimating current solutions with a fitness function, (2)
      performing crossover and mutation, (3) starting the entire proces over on
      the new, improved population
    </div>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<aside class="note">
  <p>
    Because genetic algorithm involves working on random numbers, it's an
    example of a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_algorithm"
      >probabilistic method</a
    >.
  </p>

  <p>
    Probabilistic algorithms trade <b>accuracy</b> for <b>performance</b> - they
    don't always return the best answers, but usually get
    <i>Pretty Close Pretty Cheaply ®</i>.
  </p>
</aside>

<p>
  Vegetable manufacturers don't want you to know this, but there exists a
  straightforward procedure to becoming a carrot tycoon that's actually based on
  a genetic algorithm:
</p>

<listing lang="text">
  <!--
    10  go to your garden
    20  sow a few random carrots
    30  wait for those carrots to sprout
    40  choose the best carrot-children and sow them
    50  goto 30
    
    in this world:
    - population = carrots
    - individual = carrot
    - mutation & crossover = happen automatically (free labor!)
    - fitness function = your eyes & brain
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  By now, most of those words ought to sound familiar to you - we've already
  gone through the basics of evolutionary computation in the first article; by
  the end of <i>this</i> article, you'll have answered questions such as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      but how do you <b>choose</b> the individuals? there must be like a
      thousand ways to do it! <br />
      <i>(psst: oh my yes, there are)</i>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      but how do you <b>represent</b> their genomes? there must be like a
      thousand ways to do it! <br />
      <i>(psst: oh my yes, there are)</i>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      but how do you <b>implement</b> it in Rust? you promised it'll work inside
      a web browser! <br />
      <i>(psst: oh my yes, it will)</i>
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We'll start by creating a second crate inside our workspace:</p>

<listing lang="shell">
  <!--
    $ cd shorelark/libs
    $ cargo new genetic-algorithm --lib
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  Oh, that's some nice <code>genetic-algorithm/src/lib.rs</code> Cargo created
  for us in there - let's replace it with a just as good entry point:
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    pub struct GeneticAlgorithm;
    
    impl GeneticAlgorithm {
        pub fn new() -> Self {
            Self
        }
    }
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  Our genetic algorithm, as all
  <a
    href="https://exceptionnotfound.net/god-objects-the-daily-software-anti-pattern/"
    >good objects</a
  >
  do, will provide only one functionality - sometimes it's called
  <code>iterate</code>, sometimes it's called <code>step</code> or
  <code>process</code>; I've tossed a coin and decided on:
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    impl GeneticAlgorithm {
        /* ... */
    
        pub fn evolve(&self) {
            todo!()
        }
    }
  -->
</listing>

<p>What are we evolving? A population, of course!</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    impl GeneticAlgorithm {
        pub fn evolve(&self, population: &[???]) -> Vec<???> {
            todo!()
        }
    }
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  Our actual problem will depend on neural networks, but since we want for this
  library to be generic, we can't force it to accept a hard-coded
  <code>NeuralNetwork</code> - instead, we can introduce a
  <b>type parameter</b>:
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    impl GeneticAlgorithm {
        pub fn evolve<I>(&self, population: &[I]) -> Vec<I> {
            todo!()
        }
    }
  -->
</listing>

<aside class="note">
  <p><code>I</code> stands for <b>individual</b>.</p>

  <p>As for the Rust's terminology:</p>

  <listing lang="rust">

  <p>If you wanted to read this signature aloud, you'd say:</p>

  <p>
    <i
      >public function <code>foo</code> is <b>generic over</b> lifetime
      <code>a</code> and type <code>T</code>, and it <b>accepts</b> a single
      parameter named <code>bar</code> that is a reference to <code>T</code>.</i
    >
  </p>

  <p>
    That was function's <b>definition</b> - on the other hand, the place where
    you <b>invoke</b> a function is named <b>call site</b> and the values you
    specify there are called <b>arguments</b>:
  </p>

  <listing lang="rust">
    <!--
      // v-----------------------v call site
         foo::<'static, f32>(&1.0);
      //       ^-----^  ^-^  ^--^
      //       |        |    |

      //       |        type argument
      //       lifetime argument
    -->
  </listing>

  <p>
    Most of this vernacular (e.g. the difference between <i>argument</i> and
    <i>parameter</i>) is universal across all the programming languages, so it's
    worth remembering.
  </p>
</aside>

<p>Learning from past mistakes, let's not forget about <b>preconditions</b>:</p>

<listing lang="rust">

        assert!(!population.is_empty());

  -->
</listing>

<p>As for the algorithm itself - the outline is:</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    pub fn evolve<I>(&self, population: &[I]) -> Vec<I> {
        /* ... */
    
        (0..population.len())

</h2>

<p>
  At this point, inside the loop, we have to pick two individuals - they will
  become parents and "create" us a digital offspring.
</p>

<p class="text-dim">
  <i
    >(imagining that chip made of sand can create "offspring" hits my
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley">uncanny valley</a>
    right in the feels.)</i
  >
</p>

<p>
  Choosing individuals is called the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_(genetic_algorithm)"
    >selection stage</a
  >
  of a genetic algorithm, and it should satisfy following two properties:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>each individual should have a <b>non-zero</b> chance of being picked,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      an individual with a higher fitness score should get picked, on average,
      <b>more often</b> than an individual with a lower fitness score.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Because we'll have to know fitness scores, let's start off by thinking how we
  want users to specify their <b>fitness function</b>; as trivial as it sounds,
  there are at least two <i>exceptive</i> approaches we can apply:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Fitness function as a <i>parameter</i>:</p>

    <listing lang="rust">
      <!--
        pub fn evolve<I>(
            &self,
            population: &[I],
            evaluate_fitness: &dyn Fn(&I) -> f32,
        ) -> Vec<I> {
            /* ... */
        }
      -->
    </listing>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fitness score as a <i>property</i> of an individual:</p>

    <listing lang="rust">
      <!--
        pub trait Individual {
            fn fitness(&self) -> f32;
        }
        
        pub fn evolve<I>(&self, population: &[I]) -> Vec<I>
        where
            I: Individual,
        {
            /* ... */
        }
      -->
    </listing>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>First approach:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      ✅ allows to provide many different fitness functions for one kind of an
      individual, which <i>might</i> prove to be useful for somebody (not us,
      though),
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      ❌ requires specifying fitness function for each invocation of
      <code>.evolve()</code>, which feels a bit shoehorned.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Second approach:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      ✅ allows to <b>encapsulate</b> all the individual-oriented attributes
      into a single trait, making it easy for users to discover what they need
      to provide,
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      ❌ specifying different fitness functions is possible, but a bit more
      tricky (can you figure out how and why?).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  My guts vote 133:7 for introducing a trait (a trait that, as you'll see later,
  we would need anyway), so a trait it is.
</p>

<p>
  As for the selection method, we'll use an algorithm called
  <a
    href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/genetic_algorithms/genetic_algorithms_parent_selection.htm"
    >fitness proportionate selection</a
  >
  (also known as <b>roulette wheel selection</b>), as it's easy to reason about;
  to understand how it works, let's imagine we have following three individuals:
</p>

<table class="tableblock frame-all grid-all stretch">
  <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 20%" />
    <col style="width: 20%" />
    <col style="width: 60%" />
  </colgroup>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th class="tableblock halign-left valign-top">Individual</th>
      <th class="tableblock halign-left valign-top">Fitness score</th>
      <th class="tableblock halign-left valign-top">Fitness score %</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top">
        <p class="tableblock">A</p>
      </td>
      <td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top">
        <p class="tableblock">3</p>
      </td>
      <td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top">
        <p class="tableblock">
          <code>3 / (1 + 2 + 3)</code> = <code>3 / 6</code> = <code>50%</code>
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top">
        <p class="tableblock">B</p>
      </td>
      <td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top">
        <p class="tableblock">2</p>
      </td>
      <td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top">
        <p class="tableblock">
          <code>2 / (1 + 2 + 3)</code> = <code>2 / 6</code> = <code>33%</code>
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top">
        <p class="tableblock">C</p>
      </td>
      <td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top">
        <p class="tableblock">1</p>
      </td>
      <td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top">
        <p class="tableblock">
          <code>1 / (1 + 2 + 3)</code> = <code>1 / 6</code> = <code>16%</code>
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  If we placed them all on a roulette wheel - or a pie chart, for all it matters
  - with each individual getting a slice of wheel as large as proportion of
  their fitness score to the rest:
</p>

<figure class="sketch w-50">
  <img src="{{ assets }}/sketches/coding-selection-1.svg" />

  <figcaption>
    <div class="title">
      A pie chart - or a roulette wheel, if you squeeze your eyes enough -
      illustrating individuals from the table above
    </div>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  ... randomizing an individual would boil down to "spinning" the wheel with
  random force and seeing what came up:
</p>

<figure class="sketch w-50">
  <img src="{{ assets }}/sketches/coding-selection-2.svg" />
</figure>

<aside class="note">
  <p>
    In practice, fitness proportionate selection is rather frowned upon - it's
    because it allows for the best individuals to <b>dominate</b> the
    simulation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Say, your genetic algorithm finds a solution that's exponentially better
    than the rest:
  </p>

  <figure class="sketch w-50">
    <img src="{{ assets }}/sketches/coding-selection-3.svg" />
  </figure>

  <p>
    ... when it happens, fitness proportionate selection will happily choose
    this green solution 99% of the time, making rest of the individuals an army
    of copy-pasted, green clones.
  </p>

  <p>You might think:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>isn't finding the best solution, like, the whole point?</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    ... it is; but it's important to remember that solutions found by genetic
    algorithm are always best <b>to date</b> - if you discard a
    <i>seemingly</i> unpromising candidate too early, you will never know
    whether tuning some parameter wouldn't make it an even better solution
    <i>in the long run</i>.
  </p>

  <p>To put it another way:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      the more <b>diverse</b> humans you have, the greater chance one of them is
      a trombone prodigy
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    For simplicity, we'll continue with the roulette wheel selection - but
    should you feel frisky, I'll just say that
    <a
      href="https://setu677.medium.com/how-to-perform-roulette-wheel-and-rank-based-selection-in-a-genetic-algorithm-d0829a37a189"
      >rank selection</a
    >
    is example of an algorithm that doesn't exhibit this dominating behavior,
    and it will work with our birdies, too!
  </p>
</aside>

<p>
  Living up to the generic-ness promise, instead of hard-coding our library to
  always use roulette wheel selection, let's create a trait - this way users
  will be able to use any algorithm they fancy:
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    pub trait SelectionMethod {
        fn select(&self);
    }
  -->
</listing>

<p>A selection method has to have access to the entire population:</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    pub trait SelectionMethod {
        fn select<I>(&self, population: &[I]) -> &I
        where
            I: Individual;
    }
  -->
</listing>

<p>For clarity, let's annotate the output's lifetime:</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    pub trait SelectionMethod {
        fn select<'a, I>(&self, population: &'a [I]) -> &'a I
        where
            I: Individual;
    }
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  We're going to need random numbers any minute now, so let's add
  <code>rand</code> to <code>libs/genetic-algorithm/Cargo.toml</code>:
</p>

<listing lang="toml">
  <!--
    # ...
    
    [dependencies]
    rand = "0.8"
    
    [dev-dependencies]
    rand_chacha = "0.3"
  -->
</listing>

<aside class="note">
  <p>
    Each crate in a workspace has <b>its own</b> set of dependencies - the
    <code>rand</code> we've previously added to
    <code>libs/neural-network/Cargo.toml</code> is <i>not</i> automatically
    visible in any other crate in the workspace.
  </p>
</aside>

<p>
  Learning from our past troubles with <code>thread_rng()</code>, let's already
  pass the pseudo-random number generator via a parameter:
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    use rand::RngCore;
    
    pub trait SelectionMethod {
        fn select<'a, I>(
           &self,
           rng: &mut dyn RngCore,
           population: &'a [I],
        ) -> &'a I
        where
            I: Individual;
    }
  -->
</listing>

<p>Ain't that a beautiful signature?</p>

<aside class="note">
  <p>
    You might be wondering why we don't take a step further and make
    <code>select()</code> generic over the PRNG, too:
  </p>

  <listing lang="rust">
    <!--
      pub trait SelectionMethod {
          fn select<'a, R, I>(
             &self,
             rng: &mut R,
             population: &'a [I],
          ) -> &'a I
          where
              R: RngCore,
              I: Individual;
      }
    -->
  </listing>

  <p>First, let's catch up on the vernacular - in general:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <code>dyn Trait</code>, <code>&dyn Trait</code> and
        <code>&mut dyn Trait</code> imply <b>dynamic dispatch</b>,

        <code>T</code>, <code>&T</code> and <code>&mut T</code> imply

  <p>
    Dispatching is the way compiler answers the question "which method should
    get called here, exactly?" for generic types:
  </p>

  <listing lang="rust">
    <!--
      fn foo() {
         bar();
      
         // ^ compiling this call is easy, because it always transfers
         // control into `bar`
      }
      
      fn bar() {
         println!("yas queen");
      }
      
      fn method(obj: &dyn SomeTrait) {
          obj.method();
      
          // ^ compiling this call is harder, because there's no single
          // function this could refer to - each implementation of the
          // trait might provide its own `fn method()`
          //
          // in general, this is called *polymorphism*
      }
    -->
  </listing>

  <p>
    For the sake of an example, let's consider this trait with its two
    implementations:
  </p>

  <listing lang="rust">
    <!--
      trait Animal {
          fn kind(&self) -> &'static str;
      }
      
      // --
      
      struct Chinchilla;
      
      impl Animal for Chinchilla {
          fn kind(&self) -> &'static str {
              "chinchilla"
          }
      }
      
      // --
      
      struct Viscacha;
      
      impl Animal for Viscacha {
          fn kind(&self) -> &'static str {
              "viscacha"
          }
      }
    -->
  </listing>

  <p>
    If you wanted to create a function that prints kind of <i>any</i> animal,
    you could do it twofold:
  </p>

  <div class="listing-title">
    <a
      href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=d5d734320717f0fda4d16de1f2600764"
      >open in playground</a
    >
  </div>

  <listing lang="rust">
    <!--
      // Uses static dispatch
      // (aka static polymorphism)
      fn print_kind_static<A>(animal: &A)
          where A: Animal
      {
          println!("{}", animal.kind());
      }
      
      // Uses dynamic dispatch
      // (aka dynamic polymorphism, aka runtime polymorphism)
      fn print_kind_dynamic(animal: &dyn Animal) {
          println!("{}", animal.kind());
      }
      
      fn main() {
          print_kind_static(&Chinchilla);
          print_kind_static(&Viscacha);
      
          print_kind_dynamic(&Chinchilla);
          print_kind_dynamic(&Viscacha);
      }
    -->
  </listing>

  <p>
    From a distance, both function look alike - what's the difference, then?
  </p>

  <p>
    <code>print_kind_static()</code> uses a technique called
    <b>monomorphization</b> - meaning that for each <code>Animal</code> this
    function is invoked with, compiler transparently generates a dedicated,
    "copy-pasted" version of that function:
  </p>

  <listing lang="rust">
    <!--
      fn print_kind_static__chinchilla(animal: &Chinchilla) {
          println!("{}", Chinchilla::kind(animal));
      }
      
      fn print_kind_static__viscacha(animal: &Viscacha) {
          println!("{}", Viscacha::kind(animal));
      }
      
      fn main() {
          print_kind_static__chinchilla(&Chinchilla);
          print_kind_static__viscacha(&Viscacha);
      }
    -->
  </listing>

  <p>
    At this point you can see why it's called <i>static</i> dispatch -
    underneath, compiler replaces <i>dynamic</i> traits with
    <i>static</i> types.
  </p>

  <p>
    Monomorphization has a drawback of being a bit slower to compile (instead of
    just one function, compiler has to process many of them), but usually it
    results in a faster, more optimized code at runtime; it can make a
    noticeable difference for applications that call such generic functions,
    say, million times per second.
  </p>

  <p>
    <code>print_kind_dynamic()</code>, on the other hand, uses a technique
    called <b>vtable</b> ("virtual table"), where each implementation is created
    a dedicated "proxy table" that maps to concrete functions:
  </p>

  <listing lang="rust">
    <!--
      // This is pseudo-Rust, just to show the concept
      
      struct AnimalVtable {
          // Pointer to a concrete implementation of the `kind()` method
          kind: fn(*const ()) -> &'static str,
      }
      
      const CHINCHILLA_VTABLE: AnimalVtable = AnimalVtable {
          kind: Chinchilla::kind,
      };
      
      const VISCACHA_VTABLE: AnimalVtable = AnimalVtable {
          kind: Viscacha::kind,
      };
      
      fn print_kind_dynamic(
          animal_obj: *const(),
          animal_vtable: &AnimalVtable,
      ) {
          println!("{}", animal_vtable.kind(animal_obj));
      }
      
      fn main() {
          print_kind_dynamic(&Chinchilla, &CHINCHILLA_VTABLE);
          print_kind_dynamic(&Viscacha, &VISCACHA_VTABLE);
      }
    -->
  </listing>

  <p>
    Since all implementations can be described via <code>AnimalVtable</code>,
    <code>print_kind_dynamic()</code> doesn't have to be monomorphized -
    depending on the underlying type, compiler will simply pass different
    vtable.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this case, the drawback is that each time you call
    <code>print_kind_dynamic()</code>, it has to go through this additional
    "proxy table", which makes it <i>theoretically</i> slower than
    <code>print_kind_static()</code>; more often than not the difference is not
    meaningful, though.
  </p>

  <p>
    Circling back to the original question: so why not
    <code>where R: RngCore</code>?
  </p>

  <p>
    Because we won't be invoking this PRNG million times per second, and so the
    additional maintenance burden is - to me - a cake not worth the candle.
  </p>
</aside>

<p>As for the implementation, we <i>could</i> do it by hand:</p>

<p>At this point we've got two problems:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Since <code>Individual</code> is a trait, how can we <i>fake it</i> for
      testing purposes?
    </p>

      Since <code>.select()</code> returns just a single individual, how can we

      (<a href="https://xkcd.com/221/">obligatory xkcd</a>.)
    </p>

<p>
  Starting from the top: creating fake objects for testing purposes is called
  <b>mocking</b> - and while

  My suggestion - that doesn't require any external crates - it to create a
  dedicated testing-struct:
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--

    pub struct TestIndividual {
        fitness: f32,

        fn fitness(&self) -> f32 {
            self.fitness
        }
    }
  -->
</listing>

<p>... which can be then used as:</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--

        /* ... */
    }

<p>What about the assertion, though? A test such as this one:</p>

<listing lang="rust">

        assert!(actual, &population[2]);
    }
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  ... doesn't inspire confidence, as it doesn't <b>prove</b> that fitness scores
  are being considered; a hypothetical, <i>invalid</i> implementation:
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    impl SelectionMethod for RouletteWheelSelection {

<p>Voilà - we've tested the untestable!</p>

<p>
  Before moving on, let's take a moment to ponder the nature of existence - and
  maybe rustify our code a little bit as there are some things we could get
  improved.
</p>

<p>
  First, constructing maps via <code>::from_iter()</code> is kinda messy - not
  only you have to create a vector on the way, but you're limited to
  <code>(key, value)</code> tuples that look foreign to an untrained eye.
</p>

<p>
  As always when it comes to Rust's syntax being overly verbose: just macro it
  ™; in case we'll make use of a crate named
  <a href="https://docs.rs/maplit/1.0.2/maplit/">maplit</a>:
</p>

<listing lang="toml">
  <!--
    # ...
    
    [dev-dependencies]
    # ...
    maplit = "1.0"
  -->
</listing>

<p>... that provides a handy macro called <code>btreemap!</code>:</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    #[test]
    fn test() {
        /* ... */
    
        let expected_histogram = maplit::btreemap! {
            // fitness => how many times this fitness has been chosen
            1 => 98,
            2 => 202,
            3 => 278,
            4 => 422,
        };
    
        /* ... */
    }
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  Moreover, we can use
  <a
    href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.fold"
    ><code>Iterator::fold()</code></a
  >
  to simplify the loop:
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    #[test]
    fn test() {
        /* ... */
    
        let actual_histogram: BTreeMap<i32, _> = (0..1000)
            .map(|_| method.select(&mut rng, &population))
            .fold(Default::default(), |mut histogram, individual| {
                *histogram
                    .entry(individual.fitness() as _)
                    .or_default() += 1;
    
                histogram
            });
    
        /* ... */
    }
  -->
</listing>

<aside class="note">
  <p>
    <code>as _</code> means "compiler, pretty please <b>infer</b> what type is
    required and cast this value into it".
  </p>

  <p>
    While this operation <i>feels</i> pointless, it performs the same function
    it did a few code blocks above (i.e. converting <code>f32</code> to
    <code>i32</code>) - the only difference is that now that we've explicitly
    stated our map's key using <code>: BTreeMap&lt;i32, _&gt;</code>, we don't
    have to do it inside the casting.
  </p>

  <p>
    <i
      >(it wouldn't be wrong to repeat the type and write <code>as i32</code> -
      it's just my preference to avoid duplicating type annotations.)</i
    >
  </p>

  <p>Another way we could've written this code is:</p>

  <listing lang="rust">
    <!--
      let actual_histogram = (0..1000)
          .map(|_| method.select(&mut rng, &population))
          .fold(BTreeMap::default(), |mut histogram, individual| {
              *histogram
                  .entry(individual.fitness() as i32)
                  .or_default() += 1;
      
              histogram
          });
    -->
  </listing>

  <p>
    All those three approaches (including the initial one with an explicit loop)
    are equally valid Rust code - use whichever one you find the most readable.
  </p>
</aside>

<p>Having the selection algorithm ready, let's recap where we stopped:</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    pub fn evolve<I>(&self, population: &[I]) -> Vec<I>
    where
        I: Individual,
    {
        /* ... */
    
        (0..population.len())
            .map(|_| {
                // TODO selection
                // TODO crossover
                // TODO mutation
                todo!()
            })
            .collect()
    }
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  What we have to figure out now is how to pass
  <code>SelectionMethod</code> there - I see two approaches:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Using parameter:</p>

    <listing lang="rust">
      <!--
        pub fn evolve<I, S>(
            &self,
            population: &[I],
            selection_method: &S,
        ) -> Vec<I>
        where
            I: Individual,
            S: SelectionMethod,
        {
            /* ... */
        }
      -->
    </listing>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using constructor:</p>

    <listing lang="rust">
      <!--
        pub struct GeneticAlgorithm<S> {
            selection_method: S,
        }
        
        impl<S> GeneticAlgorithm<S>
        where
            S: SelectionMethod,
        {
            pub fn new(selection_method: S) -> Self {
                Self { selection_method }
            }
        
            pub fn evolve<I, S>(&self, population: &[I]) -> Vec<I>
            where
                I: Individual,
            {
                /* ... */
            }
        }
      -->
    </listing>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  When I'm facing this kind of decision, I think <i>how often</i> users will
  need to affect that particular value: a population is usually different each
  time someone calls <code>.evolve()</code>, so it's convenient to accept it via
  parameter; on the other hand, selection algorithm generally remains identical
  for the whole simulation, so it'll be wiser to go with constructor.
</p>

<p>Now we're almost ready to invoke the selection method:</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    pub fn evolve<I>(&self, population: &[I]) -> Vec<I>
    where
        I: Individual,
    {
        /* ... */
    
        (0..population.len())
            .map(|_| {
                let parent_a = self
                    .selection_method
                    .select(population);
    
                let parent_b = self
                    .selection_method
                    .select(population);
    
                // TODO crossover
                // TODO mutation
                todo!()
            })
            .collect()
    }
  -->
</listing>

<p>... the only thing we're missing is the PRNG:</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    pub fn evolve<I>(
        &self,
        rng: &mut dyn RngCore,
        population: &[I],
    ) -> Vec<I>
    where
        I: Individual,
    {
        /* ... */
    
        (0..population.len())
            .map(|_| {
                let parent_a = self
                    .selection_method
                    .select(rng, population);
    
                let parent_b = self
                    .selection_method
                    .select(rng, population);
    
                // TODO crossover
                // TODO mutation
                todo!()
            })
            .collect()
    }
  -->
</listing>

<aside class="note">
  <p>
    You might be wondering why <code>rng</code> is passed via
    <code>.evolve()</code> instead of going through the constructor - surely the
    random number generator doesn't change <i>that</i> frequently!
  </p>

  <p>
    Well, this decision was more subtle - to understand why, let's explore other
    ways we could have written that code:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>By accepting an <b>owned</b> PRNG via the constructor:</p>

      <listing lang="rust">
        <!--
          pub struct GeneticAlgorithm<R> {
              rng: R,
          }
          
          impl<R> GeneticAlgorithm<R>
          where
              R: RngCore,
          {
              pub fn new(rng: R) -> Self {
                  Self { rng }
              }
          }
        -->
      </listing>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>By accepting a <b>borrowed</b> PRNG via the constructor:</p>

      <listing lang="rust">
        <!--
          pub struct GeneticAlgorithm<'r> {
              rng: &'mut dyn RngCore,
          }
          
          impl<'r> GeneticAlgorithm<'r> {
              pub fn new(rng: &'r mut dyn RngCore) -> Self {
                  Self { rng }
              }
          }
        -->
      </listing>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    The first approach is something I <i>would</i> suggest had we been
    implementing our simulation in C# or Java - it's a different story in Rust,
    because if we <i>move</i> <code>rng</code> inside the constructor, we won't
    be able to use it in other places of the application:
  </p>

  <listing lang="rust">
    <!--
      fn main() {
          let rng = /* ... */;
          let ga = GeneticAlgorithm::new(rng);
      
          // oh no, we can't use this `rng` anymore!
          if rng.gen_bool() {
              /* ... */
          } else {
              /* ... */
          }
      }
    -->
  </listing>

  <p>
    You could argue the same already happens for <code>SelectionMethod</code>:
  </p>

  <listing lang="rust">
    <!--
      fn main() {
          let sp = RouletteWheelSelection::new();
          let ga = GeneticAlgorithm::new(sp);
      
          // oh no, we can't use this `sp` anymore!
          if sp.something() {
              /* ... */
          }
      }
    -->
  </listing>

  <p>
    ... but in my opinion there's a difference in that <code>Rng</code> is a
    more versatile trait - it makes sense to use it outside the
    <code>GeneticAlgorithm</code>, which cannot be said about
    <code>SelectionMethod</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    All said, you'd be right to call this a far-fetched explanation - picking a
    "more versatile" trait is nothing but a gut feeling; if you ask me, the
    owned-value approach is correct, just slightly inferior in this particular
    case.
  </p>

  <p>
    As for the <code>&mut dyn RngCore</code> variant, I consider it the worst -
    it requires a unique borrow (<code>&mut</code>) on <code>rng</code>, so not
    only it "locks" PRNG for the lifetime of the genetic algorithm:
  </p>

  <listing lang="rust">
    <!--
      fn main() {
          let rng = /* ... */;
          let ga = GeneticAlgorithm::new(&mut rng);
      
          // oh no, we still can't use this `rng`!
          let population = if rng.gen_bool() {
              /* ... */
          } else {
              /* ... */
          };
      
          ga.evolve(population);
      }
    -->
  </listing>

  <p>... but it also prevents otherwise valid use cases such as this one:</p>

  <listing lang="rust">
    <!--
      struct Simulation {
          rng: ChaCha8Rng,
          ga: GeneticAlgoritm<'whats_this_lifetime??>,
      }
    -->
  </listing>

  <p>
    By the way, this is called a <b>self-referential struct</b> - without
    referring to eldritch unsafe magicks, it cannot be declared in Rust.

<h2 id="coding-crossover">
  <a href="#coding-crossover">Coding: Crossover</a>
</h2>

<p>
  Now that we have chosen two parent-individuals, it's time for the
  <b>crossover</b> phase.
</p>

<p>
  Crossover (also known as <b>recombination</b>) takes two individuals and
  "mixes" them, yielding a new~ish solution:
</p>

<figure class="sketch w-80">
  <img src="{{ assets }}/sketches/coding-crossover-1.svg" />
</figure>

<p>
  Compared to randomizing brand new individuals, crossover is neat in the sense
  that it tries to <b>preserve knowledge</b> - the idea is that combining two
  solutions will usually yield a solution that's both new <i>and</i> at least as
  good as the two solutions we already have; this allows to explore the search
  space without the risk of losing the best solutions discovered so far.
</p>

<p>
  As in real world, crossover doesn't actually happen on an individual, but
  rather on their <b>chromosomes</b> - which is a fancy word for "an encoding of
  a solution":
</p>

<figure class="sketch w-80">
  <img src="{{ assets }}/sketches/coding-crossover-2.svg" />
</figure>

<p>
  A chromosome (also called <b>genotype</b>, though I'm convinced a biologist
  dies each time someone juxtaposes both terms) is usually built from
  <b>genes</b>, and its structure depends on the underlying problem - sometimes
  it's convenient to model a chromosome as a bitset:
</p>

<figure class="sketch w-50">
  <img src="{{ assets }}/sketches/coding-crossover-3.svg" />
</figure>

<p>... sometimes it's more convenient to have a string:</p>

<figure class="sketch w-50">
  <img src="{{ assets }}/sketches/coding-crossover-4.svg" />
</figure>

<p>
  ... and we'll re-use what we already have - a bunch of floating-point numbers
  (i.e. weights of the neural network):
</p>

<figure class="sketch w-50">
  <img src="{{ assets }}/sketches/coding-crossover-5.svg" />
</figure>

<p>As for the code:</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    #[derive(Clone, Debug)]
    pub struct Chromosome {
        genes: Vec<f32>,
    }
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  Instead of exposing genes directly (via <code>pub genes: …​</code>), we'll
  provide a handful of functions allowing to peek inside the chromosome:
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    impl Chromosome {
        pub fn len(&self) -> usize {
            self.genes.len()
        }
    
        pub fn iter(&self) -> impl Iterator<Item = &f32> {
            self.genes.iter()
        }
    
        pub fn iter_mut(&mut self) -> impl Iterator<Item = &mut f32> {
            self.genes.iter_mut()
        }
    }
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  If you're assiduous, you might even write a handful of tests for them; some
  people would consider testing such tiny functions overzealous, but I say we go
  for it:
</p>

      ><code>min_type_alias_impl_trait</code></a

    - it allows to use <code>impl Trait</code> in places such as associated

        >an existential type</a

    >
  </p>

  <p>If not for this feature, we'd have to figure out the type on our own:</p>

        })
        .collect()

<p>
  As for the crossover itself, there are
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(genetic_algorithm)#Examples"
    >many</a
  >
  algorithms we could implement - usually it's best to try a few of them and see
  whichever plays best with given problem; for simplicity, we'll go with
  <b>uniform crossover</b>, which can be described with a single drawing:
</p>

<figure class="sketch">
  <img src="{{ assets }}/sketches/coding-crossover-6.svg" />
</figure>

<p>Same as before, let's start with a trait:</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    pub trait CrossoverMethod {
        fn crossover(
            &self,
            rng: &mut dyn RngCore,
            parent_a: &Chromosome,
            parent_b: &Chromosome,
        ) -> Chromosome;
    }
  -->
</listing>

<p>... and now a rudimentary implementation:</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    use rand::Rng;
    
    #[derive(Clone, Debug)]
    pub struct UniformCrossover;
    
    impl UniformCrossover {
        pub fn new() -> Self {
            Self
        }
    }
    
    impl CrossoverMethod for UniformCrossover {
        fn crossover(
            &self,
            rng: &mut dyn RngCore,
            parent_a: &Chromosome,
            parent_b: &Chromosome,
        ) -> Chromosome {
            let mut child = Vec::new();
            let gene_count = parent_a.len();
    
            for gene_idx in 0..gene_count {
                let gene = if rng.gen_bool(0.5) {
                    parent_a[gene_idx]
                } else {

                };
    
                child.push(gene);
            }
    
            child.into_iter().collect()
        }
    }
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  Your internal code reviewer might notice a few things <i>off</i> about this
  code - rightfully so!
</p>

<p>First, let's add an assertion:</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    fn crossover(/* ... */) -> Chromosome {
        assert_eq!(parent_a.len(), parent_b.len());
    
        /* ... */
    }
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  Second, let's use a <span class="text-rainbow">combinator</span>; we already
  know this one from the previous post - it's
  <a
    href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.zip"
    ><code>.zip()</code></a
  >:
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    fn crossover(/* ... */) -> Chromosome {
        /* ... */
    
        let parent_a = parent_a.iter();
        let parent_b = parent_b.iter();
    
        parent_a
            .zip(parent_b)
            .map(|(&a, &b)| if rng.gen_bool(0.5) { a } else { b })
            .collect()
    }
  -->
</listing>

<p>How neat!</p>

<p>
  Notice how by implementing <code>.iter()</code> and
  <code>FromIterator</code> a moment ago, we were able to reduce code in here to
  a bare minimum that conveys the <i>essence</i> of the uniform crossover. Apart
  from improved readability, what I love about combinators the most is that they
  don't sacrifice performance - if anything, the variant above will be faster
  (preallocation!).
</p>

<p>
  Your internal sceptic might still be alerted that something's missing…​ hmm…​
  ah, tests!
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    #[cfg(test)]

        fn test() {
            let mut rng = ChaCha8Rng::from_seed(Default::default());
            let parent_a = todo!();
            let parent_b = todo!();
    
            let child = UniformCrossover::new()
                .crossover(&mut rng, &parent_a, &parent_b);
    
            assert!(/* ... */);
        }

</listing>

<p>
  What we want to verify, in plain words, is that <code>child</code> is 50%
  <code>parent_a</code> + 50% <code>parent_b</code>.
</p>

<p>
  My suggestion is to generate two <i>distinct</i> chromosomes (they don't have
  to be random, just build out of different genes):
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    let parent_a: Chromosome =
        (1..=100)
            .map(|n| n as f32)
            .collect();
    
    let parent_b: Chromosome =
        (1..=100)
            .map(|n| -n as f32)
            .collect();
    
    // First parent will be:
    //   [1, 2, /* ... */, 100]
    //
    // Second parent will look similar, but with reversed signs:
    //   [-1, -2, /* ... */, -100]
    //
    // Just like in the histogram, the concrete number of genes doesn't
    // matter - 100 will nicely round up to 100%, that's all
  -->
</listing>

<p>... and compare how much <code>child</code> differs from each of them:</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    // Number of genes different between `child` and `parent_a`
    let diff_a = child
        .iter()
        .zip(parent_a)
        .filter(|(c, p)| *c != p)
        .count();
    
    // Number of genes different between `child` and `parent_b`
    let diff_b = child
        .iter()
        .zip(parent_b)
        .filter(|(c, p)| *c != p)
        .count();
    
    assert_eq!(diff_a, 0);
    assert_eq!(diff_b, 0);
  -->
</listing>

<p>Given this code, <code>cargo test</code> returns:</p>

<listing lang="text">
  <!--
    thread '...' panicked at 'assertion failed: `(left == right)`
      left: `49`,
     right: `0`'
  -->
</listing>

<p>... so let's adjust the test:</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    assert_eq!(diff_a, 49);
  -->
</listing>

<p>Another <code>cargo test</code> will fail on the second assertion:</p>

<listing lang="text">
  <!--
    thread '...' panicked at 'assertion failed: `(left == right)`
      left: `51`,
     right: `0`'
  -->
</listing>

<p>... so:</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    assert_eq!(diff_b, 51);
  -->
</listing>

<p>To recall, what we've got is:</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    assert_eq!(diff_a, 49);
    assert_eq!(diff_b, 51);
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  ... meaning that our <code>child</code> got 49% of its genome from
  <code>parent_a</code>, and 51% from <code>parent_b</code>; this ultimately
  proves our uniform crossover picks genes from both parents at equal
  probability.
</p>

<p class="text-dim">
  (we didn't get an exact 50% - 50% match, but that's just probability being
  probability.)
</p>

<p>
  Now we can pass <code>CrossoverMethod</code> next to
  <code>SelectionMethod</code>:
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    pub struct GeneticAlgorithm<S> {
        selection_method: S,
        crossover_method: Box<dyn CrossoverMethod>,

            Self {

                crossover_method: Box::new(crossover_method),
            }
        }
    
        /* ... */
    }

<aside class="note">
  <p>
    Contrary to <code>SelectionMethod::select()</code>,

    we can <code>Box</code> it; another solution would be:

  <p>
    The trade-off here is exactly the same as when we were talking about
    <code>T</code> vs <code>dyn Trait</code>, with the code directly above us
    using static dispatch (monomorphization) and
    <code>Box&lt;dyn Trait&gt;</code> being dynamic dispatch.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because Rust makes it so easy to create genetic parameter upon generic
    parameter,
    <a href="http://troubles.md/rust-optimization/#avoid-box-trait"
      >some people</a
    >
    argue that using <code>Box</code> - which has a theoretical performance
    penalty - makes for a less idiomatic, slower Rust code.
  </p>

  <p>
    My personal stance is that <code>Box</code> is a convenient mechanism whose
    potential runtime trade-off is paid by keeping a code that's easier to
    maintain; I'd say: use <code>Box</code> unless benchmarks prove it's an
    issue / unless it makes the code awkward to read.

<h2 id="coding-mutation">
  <a href="#coding-mutation">Coding: Mutation</a>
</h2>

<p>
  Now that we have a semi-new chromosome at hand, it's time to introduce some
  diversity!
</p>

<p>
  Mutation, next to crossover and selection, is the third
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_operator">genetic operator</a>
  - it takes a chromosome and introduces one or many random changes to it:
</p>

<figure class="sketch w-50">
  <img src="{{ assets }}/sketches/coding-mutation-1.svg" />
</figure>

<p>
  As in <i>The Actual Evolution</i>®, mutation's role is to allow to explore
  solutions that were not present in the initial population; it also helps to
  avoid getting stuck in a local optimum, as it keeps the population ceaselessly
  changed, from one generation to another.
</p>

<p>
  Since we already have <code>Chromosome</code> implemented, mutation's going to
  be smooth as butter:
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    pub trait MutationMethod {
        fn mutate(&self, rng: &mut dyn RngCore, child: &mut Chromosome);
    }
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  We'll use <code>Gaussian mutation</code>, which is a fancy way of saying
  "we'll add or subtract random numbers from the genome". Contrary to our
  parameter-less selection method, Gaussian mutation requires specifying two
  arguments:
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    #[derive(Clone, Debug)]

        /// Probability of changing a gene:

        chance: f32,

  Naming tests this way took me a while to get used to, but eventually I've
  found this convention so helpful that I cannot <i>not</i> mention it; tests
  structured like that are worth more than a million comments, because tests -
  contrary to comments - don't become obsolete over time.
</p>

<p>
  When implementing, to avoid copy-pasting, first let's create a helper
  function:

        fn actual(chance: f32, coeff: f32) -> Vec<f32> {
            let mut child = vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
                .into_iter()
                .collect();
    
            let mut rng = ChaCha8Rng::from_seed(Default::default());
    
            GaussianMutation::new(chance, coeff)
                .mutate(&mut rng, &mut child);

  <code>child</code> is of type <code>Chromosome</code>, while the vector we

<aside class="note">
  <p>
    Naming's important - sometimes instead of abstract "create", it makes more
    sense to talk in terms of "where from" and "where to".
  </p>

  <p>
    For instance, compare which one of these feels more <i>natural</i> to you:
  </p>

  <listing lang="rust">
    <!--
      pub trait Individual {
          fn create(chromosome: Chromosome) -> Self;
          fn chromosome(&self) -> &Chromosome;
          fn fitness(&self) -> f32;
      }

  <listing lang="rust">
    <!--
      pub trait Individual {
          fn from_chromosome(chromosome: Chromosome) -> Self;
          fn as_chromosome(&self) -> &Chromosome;
          fn fitness(&self) -> f32;
      }
    -->
  </listing>

  <p>
    As usually when it comes to naming, there's no single best answer; we'll
    continue with <code>::create()</code>, because we have to decide on
    <i>something</i>, but keep this example in mind next time you're scratching
    you head, thinking "What to name this function?".
  </p>

  <p>
    Just for fun, it's also possible to delegate 2/3 of those methods into
    <b>supertraits</b>:
  </p>

  <listing lang="rust">
    <!--
      pub trait Individual: From<Chromosome> + AsRef<Chromosome> {
          fn fitness(&self) -> f32;
      }
    -->
  </listing>

  <p>
    ... although I wouldn't recommend it, because supertraits make
    <code>impl</code>-s look less compact:
  </p>

<p>
  Having <code>.evolve()</code> ready, the time has come for perhaps the most
  exciting slice of this post: the telos, final, cherry-on-top
  <b><span class="text-rainbow">test</span></b> - one that will prove to
  everyone that our <code>.evolve()</code> works and that we know what we're
  doing.
</p>

<p>
  We'll start by adjusting our <code>TestIndividual</code> so that instead of
  <code>panic!()</code>-ing, it actually implements <code>::create()</code> and
  <code>.chromosome()</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Some tests - e.g. the ones for <code>RouletteWheelSelection</code> - don't
  care about genes at all, so we'll get bonus points for inventing a solution
  that doesn't require modifying those already-working tests.
</p>

<p>
  My proposition is to change <code>TestIndividual</code> from
  <code>struct</code> to an <code>enum</code> with two different variants:

<p>Since we're already here, let's derive <code>PartialEq</code>:</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    #[cfg(test)]
    #[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq)]
    pub enum TestIndividual {
        /* ... */
    }
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  We'll need <code>PartialEq</code> for <code>Chromosome</code> too; to avoid
  funky floating-point surprises, let's write it by hand using
  <code>approx</code>:
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    #[cfg(test)]
    impl PartialEq for Chromosome {
        fn eq(&self, other: &Self) -> bool {
            approx::relative_eq!(
                self.genes.as_slice(),
                other.genes.as_slice(),
            )
        }
    }
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  As for the test, nothing scary - we'll start with a few individuals, evolve
  them over a few generations, and compare the output population:
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    #[cfg(test)]
    mod tests {
        use super::*;
        use rand::SeedableRng;
        use rand_chacha::ChaCha8Rng;
    
        #[test]
        fn test() {
            let mut rng = ChaCha8Rng::from_seed(Default::default());
    
            let ga = GeneticAlgorithm::new(
                RouletteWheelSelection::new(),

                GaussianMutation::new(0.5, 0.5),
            );
    
            let mut population = vec![
                /* todo */
            ];
    
            // We're running `.evolve()` a few times, so that the
            // differences between initial and output population are
            // easier to spot.
            //
            // No particular reason for a number of 10 - this test would
            // be fine for 5, 20 or even 1000 generations; the only thing
            // that'd change is the *magnitude* of difference between
            // initial and output population.
            for _ in 0..10 {
                population = ga.evolve(&mut rng, &population);
            }
    
            let expected_population = vec![
                /* todo */
            ];
    
            assert_eq!(population, expected_population);
        }
    }
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  We're going to create a few individuals at once, so a helper function is a
  must:
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    fn individual(genes: &[f32]) -> TestIndividual {
        let chromosome = genes.iter().cloned().collect();

<p>
  What's certain is that we've got <i>some</i> output - but how do we know those
  four individuals are actually <b>better</b> than the four we started with?
</p>

<p>Well, what do you say we look at their fitness scores:</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    // In this case, `fitness score` means `average of the genes`, as per our
    // implemetation inside `TestIndividual::fitness()`
    
    let expected_population = vec![
        individual(&[/* ... */]), // fitness ~= 6.8
        individual(&[/* ... */]), // fitness ~= 5.7
        individual(&[/* ... */]), // fitness ~= 7.8
        individual(&[/* ... */]), // fitness ~= 7.4
    ];
  -->

<p>
  <i
    >As the clandestine averages begin to caress my neurons, a juggernaut shout
    leaves my throat: it works! it works! our genetic algorithm <b>is</b> the
    apex predator of computer science!</i

<p>
  For real tho - we've got higher fitness scores, which means that our
  individuals <i>did</i> get better and everything works as intended:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Thanks to the roulette wheel selection, the worst solution -
      <code>[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]</code> - was discarded.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Thanks to the uniform crossover, the average fitness score grew from 3.5
      to 7.0 (!)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Thanks to the Gaussian mutation, we see genes - numbers - that were not
      present in the initial population.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  You don't have to believe me, though - try commenting out various parts of the
  algorithm:
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
    // self.mutation_method.mutate(rng, &mut child);
  -->
</listing>

<p>... and see how they affect the output population :-)</p>

  So far, learning <i>whoa so much</i> on the way, we've implemented two
  separate components: a neural network and a genetic algorithm.
</p>

<p>
  In the upcoming, last post of this series we'll integrate both algorithms and
  implement a snazzy user interface that'll allow us to see <i>beyond</i> lists
  of floating-point numbers. As promised, that's where the JavaScript and
  WebAssembly will come to play.
</p>

<p>As always, thank you for reading and until the next time!</p>
