  Recently I've been <s>cursed</s> blessed with the opportunity of implementing
  a library for operating on iCalendar files. If you haven't heard of them, you
  probably have - it's the format used to transfer e-mail RSVPs, to name a
  thing:

  Despite iCal's age - <a>RFC 2245</a> is dated 1998, same as the
  Clinton-Lewinsky scandal - I think it's a Pretty Good Format™. It's
  reasonably easy to print and parse:

  How do we tame this? iCalendar proposes we define:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <code>FREQ</code>, saying how an event repeats (hourly, daily, weekly, ...),
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>DTSTART</code>, saying from when an event repeats,
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  ... and that's basically it, at least when it comes to required properties:
</p>

<listing-title>
  FREQ=HOURLY;DTSTART=20180101T120000
</listing-title>

<listing lang="text">
  <!--

  -> 2018-01-01 14:00:00
  -> [...]
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  We can also specify <code>INTERVAL</code>, which produces multiplies of the
  frequency:
</p>

<listing-title>
  FREQ=DAILY;INTERVAL=3;DTSTART=20180101T120000

<p>
  But that's boring, that's something you could've come up with on your own -
  here's something fun:

<p class="text-center text-bold">

<p>
  Sounds easy, right? Or maybe not easy-easy, but - like - doable.
</p>

<p>
  Even if you're aware of potential roadblocks (how's repeating defined across
  time zone transitions?), you might have this thought that <i>intuitively</i>
  this shouldn't be a terribly difficult thing to implement.
</p>

<p>
  And you'd be right, somewhat.
</p>

<p>
  Most implementations tend to have some sort of hand-unrolled,
  frequency-specific logic:
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
  fn iter(recur: &Recur) -> impl Iterator<Item = DateTime> {
      match recur.freq {
          "yearly" => iter_yearly(recur),

      }
  }

  /* ... */

  fn iter_monthly(recur: &Recur) -> impl Iterator<Item = DateTime> {
      let mut curr = recur.dtstart;

      loop {

              // FREQ=MONTHLY;BYMONTHDAY=10,20,30 creates *new* dates that are

          curr += Span::Year * recur.interval;
      } 
  }

  /* ... */

</listing>

<p>
  That's because depending on context, a parameter can function either as a
  filter:
</p>

<listing-title>
  FREQ=DAILY;BYDAY=MO
</listing-title>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
  for day in days_since(dtstart) {
      if day.is(Monday) {
          yield day;

<p>
  ... or as a generator:
</p>

<listing-title>
  FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=MO
</listing-title>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--

      for day in month.every(Monday) {
          yield day;

<p>
  RFC collects all of those cases into a rather spooky-looking table:
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="{{ assets }}/expand-limit.png" />
</figure>

<p>
  <ref id="1">
    https://github.com/libical/libical
  </ref>
  <ref id="2">
    https://github.com/libical/libical/issues/795
  </ref>

  ... whose apparent complexity is what causes libraries to implement iCal
  features just partially, like with <a ref="1">libical</a> and the
  <a ref="2">BYSETPOS</a> rule - since it must be provided for each context in
  which it appears, it's naturally implemented only for the common use cases.
</p>

<p class="text-dim">
  (not a nitpick towards libical, it's just an example i'm aware of.)
</p>

<p>
  That's the way I started my implementation as well, but something about it
  felt off to me - I had a feeling there must be a better way to approach this.
</p>

<p>
  I began to imagine those recurrence rules as SQL queries:
</p>

<listing-title>
  FREQ=DAILY;BYDAY=MO;DTSTART=20180101
</listing-title>

<listing lang="sql">
  <!--
  select day
    from dates  -- infinite table of all possible dates
   where day_of_week(day) = 'Monday'
     and day >= '2018-01-01'
  -->
</listing>

<listing-title>
  FREQ=DAILY;BYDAY=MO,TU;BYMONTHDAY=10;DTSTART=20180101
</listing-title>

<listing lang="sql">
  <!--
  select day
    from dates
   where day_of_week(day) = 'Monday' or day_of_week(day) = 'Tuesday'
     and day_of_month(day) = 10
     and day >= '2018-01-01'
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  ... and then I realized that under this framework, the <code>FREQ</code> rule
  disappears - <code>FREQ=DAILY;BYDAY=MO</code>,
  <code>FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO</code> and <code>FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=MO</code> all
  correspond to the same query, even though in one case <code>BYDAY</code>
  functions as a filter, while in the others it's a generator:
</p>

<listing-title>
  FREQ=DAILY/WEEKLY/MONTHLY;BYDAY=MO;DTSTART=20180101
</listing-title>

<listing lang="sql">
  <!--
  select day
    from dates
   where day_of_week(day) = 'Monday'
     and day >= '2018-01-01'
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  Having this, I started to think about how I would materialize this query -
  naively we could just iterate through all of the possible dates and check
  whether all conditions match (modulo the <code>>= '2018-01-01'</code> part,
  since this hypothetical <code>dates</code> table is infinite). But maybe
  there's a better way?
</p>

<p>
  And then I realized there's a thing I can <s>steal</s> borrow from the
  rendering community.

<h2 id="love-triangles">
  The Math of Love Triangles
</h2>

<p>
  Triangles are those pointy, pointy, sexy bois:
</p>

<figure class="sketch w-30">
  <img src="{{ assets }}/triangles-1.svg" />
</figure>

<p>
  ... whose life purpose is illustrating <s>Pytagorean</s> <s>Pythagoran</s>
  <s>Pytagoream</s> Pythagorean theorem - they also tend to be used for
  modelling stuff in computer graphics and whathaveyou:
</p>

<figure class="sketch w-30">
  <img src="{{ assets }}/triangles-2.svg" />

  <figcaption>
    <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CG_WIKI.jpg" />
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  <ref>
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry
  </ref>

  Triangles are cool, because GPUs can draw millions of them per second, but
  simplicity in rendering comes at a cost. Certain operations - like <a>figuring
  out the difference of two shapes</a>:
</p>

<figure class="sketch">
  <img src="{{ assets }}/triangles-3.svg" />
</figure>

<p>
  ... are rather awkward when operating on triangles (aka polygons).
</p>

<p>
  Another way of thinking about shapes is by describing them analytically, with
  the most popular approach (citation needed) being via <b>signed distance
  functions</b>.
</p>

<p>
  A signed distance function accepts a point and returns a distance from that
  point towards the nearest surface. You might think it sounds like a difficult
  kind of thing to implement, but it's actually quite straightforward - for
  instance the SDF of a sphere of radius=1 centered at xyz=(0,0,0) is just:
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
  struct Vec3 {
      x: f32,
      y: f32,
      z: f32,
  }

  fn sphere(point: Vec3) -> f32 {
      // Calculate distance from origin (0,0,0) to given point
      let dist_to_origin = (
          point.x * point.x
          + point.y * point.y
          + point.z * point.z
      ).sqrt();

      dist_to_origin - 1.0
  }
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  ... because:
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
  sphere(vec3(2.0, 2.0, 2.0)) =~ 2.46
  // ^ we're 2.46 units away from the nearest sphere

  sphere(vec3(0.57, 0.57, 0.57)) =~ 0.0
  // ^ we're exactly *at* the sphere (0.57 = 1/sqrt(3))

  sphere(vec3(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)) = -1.0
  // ^ we're -1.0 units past the surface of sphere (we're inside of the shape)
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  Notably, an SDF returns zero when given point is located directly on the
  surface represented by the function - so if we wanted to render this surface,
  we'd take a camera:
</p>

<figure class="sketch w-20">
  <img src="{{ assets }}/camera-1.svg" />
</figure>

<p>
  ... and a viewport (a canvas onto which we're projecting the image):
</p>

<figure class="sketch">
  <img src="{{ assets }}/camera-2.svg" />
</figure>

<p>
  ... and then for each pixel of this viewport we'd shoot a ray from the camera,
  through the viewport, outward towards the world:
</p>

<figure class="sketch">
  <img src="{{ assets }}/camera-3.svg" />
</figure>

<p>
  ... and we'd slowly march through each of those rays, looking for places where
  SDF returns zero, indicating that the particular ray has reached a
  surface:
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
  fn render_image(
      sdf: fn(Vec3) -> f32,
      camera: Camera,
  ) -> Image {
      let mut image = Image::new(width, height);

      for x in 0..width {
          for y in 0..height {
              let mut curr = camera.origin;
              let dir = camera.ray((x, y));

              for _iter in 0..128 {
                  if sdf(curr) == 0.0 {
                      // Yay, reached the surface!
                      image.set_color(x, y, Color::Green);
                      break;
                  }

                  // Nay, not yet - make a small step forward!
                  curr += 0.01 * dir;
              }
          }
      }

      image
  }
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  Marching in constant steps is inefficient, though - it doesn't make a good use
  of the SDF, because it treats it as a binary function (<code>0 => yay</code>,
  <code>!= 0 => nay</code>), while in reality the SDF tells us much more.
</p>

<p>
  Instead of taking constant-length steps, we can use the value returned from
  the SDF as a guide of how long step we can make - this is known as <b>sphere
  tracing</b>:
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
  for _iter in 0..128 {
      let step = sdf(point);

      if step == 0.0 {
          image.set_color(x, y, Color::White);
          break;
      }

      curr += step * dir;
  }
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  You might think:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    but since the function tells us where the closest surface is, can't we do it
    in <code>O(1)</code> by simply calling the function once, why the loop ??
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Unfortunately, we have to call the SDF multiple times, because this function
  only tells us about the distance to the closest surface, not about distance to
  the closest surface that coincides with the direction we're walking towards:
</p>

<figure class="sketch">
  <img src="{{ assets }}/camera-4.svg" />
</figure>

<p>
  So the specific property is that an SDF returns zero when we're at the surface
  and otherwise it returns a distance to the nearest surface, or at most an
  underapproximation of this distance.
</p>

<h2 id="marching-events">
  Marching events
</h2>

<p>
  Cool, but what all of that has to do with recurring events?
</p>

<p>
  I've found a way of describing occurrences through distance functions. This
  means that instead of implementing logic for all combinations of frequencies
  and parameters - as that spooky table from before suggests one might do - we
  can simply compose a couple of distance functions together.
</p>

<p>
  Instead of 7 (frequencies) * 9 (<code>BY*</code> parameters) code paths, we
  end up with 7 + 9.
</p>

<p>
  Similarly to SDFs, what we're looking for is a function that takes a date,
  returns a span (+1 hour, +2 days etc.), and satisfies the following
  properties:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    if <code>date</code> is an occurrence of the event, this function returns
    zero,
  </li>
  <li>
    otherwise this function returns a positive span that either points at the
    next occurrence or it's an underapproximation of it.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Having those as the only requirements means we're given a lot of leeway when
  it comes to the implementation - in fact, coming up with a basic distance
  function takes just a couple lines of code:
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--

              //

  iteration 4:
      # 12:00:03 doesn't match BYSECOND=0,10,20
      curr += 1 second

  /* ... */

  iteration 11:
      # 12:00:10 matches BYSECOND=0,10,20
      yield curr
      curr += 1 second

</listing>

<p>
  ... and that's a lot of iterations, I agree - but the important bit is that
  <b>the outcome is correct</b>.
</p>

<p>
  It's inefficient, yes - but correct. This means that our approach is sound, we
  just need to find a way to make it more efficient, more practical; we need to
  optimize it.
</p>

<p>
  Of course, we also have to implement more rules, e.g. conveniently enough
  we've skipped how the <code>FREQ</code> rule is supposed to work, but no
  worries - we'll get there.
</p>

<h2 id="atoms">

<p>
  Let's ignore time for a moment. Nooo time. Zero. Null. Bliss. Remember that
  time Jeff has said something mean to you? No, you don't, because there's no
  time.
</p>

<p>
  Uhm, anyway. Let's focus on day-dates, such as <code>2018-01-01</code> - say
  we're given the following rule:
</p>

<listing lang="text">
  <!--
  FREQ=DAILY;BYDAY=MO,TU;BYMONTHDAY=10;DTSTART=20180101
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  ... which corresponds to this pseudo-SQL:
</p>

<listing lang="sql">
  <!--
  select day
    from dates
   where day_of_week(day) = 'Monday' or day_of_week(day) = 'Tuesday'
     and day_of_month(day) = 10
     and day >= '2018-01-01'
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  How do we get from here towards a good distance function? Piecewise. Let's
  tackle <code>day_of_week</code> first.
</p>

<p>
  Ignoring the context in which it appears, how would we <i>like</i> for an
  ideal <code>day-of-week</code> distance function to work? We can come up with
  a couple of examples:
</p>

<listing lang="text">
  <!--
  (day-of-week Monday 2018-01-01) = 0
  // 2018-01-01 is Monday

  (day-of-week Tuesday 2018-01-01) = +1d
  // 2018-01-01 one day away from Tuesday

  (day-of-week Friday 2018-01-01) = +5d
  // 2018-01-01 five days away from Friday
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  Since we don't care about travelling back in time, we can also state that:
</p>

<listing lang="text">
  <!--
  (day-of-week Monday 2018-01-02) = +6d
  // 2018-01-02 is technically -1d away from the nearest Monday (2018-01-01),
  // but since we want for the returned spans to be positive, let's choose the
  // next Monday (2018-01-08), which is +6d away from 2018-01-02
  -->
</listing>

<note>
  <p>
    Note that travelling back in time can be a useful property.
  </p>

  <p>
    If our function was a <i>signed</i> distance function, we could implement an
    iterator that works in both directions, i.e. we could have both
    <code>find_next_occurrence()</code> and <code>find_prev_occurrence()</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    But since it's usually the next occurrences that people want to find, we'll
    focus just on them.
  </p>
</note>

<p>
  <ref>
    https://docs.rs/jiff/latest/jiff/
  </ref>

  Now that we have a couple of examples, it's time to come up with an
  implementation - we'll use <a>Jiff</a> as the base for our algorithm, since
  I've already had a chance to play with it and it's very pleasant.
</p>

<p>
  Before we jump into the code, there's one thing we're going to simplify -
  instead of juggling <code>fn(Date) -> Span</code>, we'll go ahead with
  <code>fn(Date) -> Date</code>, where the <code>span.is_zero()</code> condition
  is encoded as the function returning the same date as the input one:
</p>

<listing lang="text">
  <!--
  (day-of-week Monday 2018-01-01) = 2018-01-01
  (day-of-week Tuesday 2018-01-01) = 2018-01-02
  (day-of-week Friday 2018-01-01) = 2018-01-05
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  This doesn't really change anything, we're just making our lives easier,
  because in practice working on dates tends to be easier than working on spans.
  Without further ado:
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
  use jiff::Span;
  use jiff::civil::{Date, Weekday};

  enum Rule {
      DayOfWeek(Weekday),
  }

  impl Rule {
      fn next(&self, curr: Date) -> Date {
          match self {
              Rule::DayOfWeek(wd) => {
                  curr + Span::new().days(curr.weekday().until(*wd))
              }
          }
      }
  }

<p>
  That wasn't so hard, was it? We can confirm it's working as intended:

<p>
  Ok, so it seems distance functions are not as scary as they seem! Or at least
  this one isn't, but I can tell you that most of them will be similarly
  intuitive.
</p>

<p>
  Moving on to <code>day-of-month</code> - as before, first let's imagine how
  we'd like for it to behave:
</p>

<listing lang="text">
  <!--
  (day-of-month 14 2018-01-14) = 2018-01-14
  // 2018-01-14 is already the 14th day of month

  (day-of-month 16 2018-01-14) = 2018-01-16
  // 2018-01-16 is the closest 16th day of month starting from 2018-01-14 (+2d)

  (day-of-month 12 2018-01-14) = 2018-02-14
  // 2018-01-12 is the closest 12th day of month starting from 2018-01-14 (-2d),
  // but that corresponds to a negative span, so we jump to the next month
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  Implementing this one is a bit more tricky, but not dangerously so - there are
  three edge cases:
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
  /* ... */
  use std::cmp::Ordering;

  enum Rule {
      /* ... */
      DayOfMonth(i8),
  }

  impl Rule {
      fn next(&self, curr: Date) -> Date {
          match self {
              /* ... */

              Rule::DayOfMonth(day) => {
                  match curr.day().cmp(day) {
                      // E.g. curr=2018-01-14 and day=16
                      Ordering::Less => todo!(),

                      // E.g. curr=2018-01-14 and day=14
                      Ordering::Equal => todo!(),

                      // E.g. curr=2018-01-14 and day=12
                      Ordering::Greater => todo!(),

              }
          }
      }
  }
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  ... out of which the <code>Less</code> and <code>Equal</code> branches are
  pretty straightforward:
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
  match self {
      /* ... */

      Rule::DayOfMonth(day) => {
          match curr.day().cmp(day) {
              // E.g. curr=2018-01-14 and day=16
              Ordering::Less => curr + Span::new().days(day - curr.day()),

              // E.g. curr=2018-01-14 and day=14
              Ordering::Equal => curr,

              // E.g. curr=2018-01-14 and day=12
              Ordering::Greater => todo!(),
          }
      }
  }
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  What about <code>=> Ordering::Greater</code>? Well, we could provide an exact
  solution:
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
  // E.g. curr=2018-01-14 and day=12
  Ordering::Greater => {
      // 2018-01-14 -> 2018-02-14
      let dst = curr + Span::months(1);

      // 2018-02-14 -> 2018-02-01
      let dst = dst.first_of_month().unwrap();

      // 2018-02-01 -> 2018-02-12
      dst + Span::days(*day - 1)
  }
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  ... but since it's legal to underapproximate, we might as well go the easier
  way:
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
  Ordering::Greater => curr.last_of_month().tomorrow().unwrap(),
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  Given <code>curr=2018-01-14</code> and <code>day=12</code>, the function will
  suggest jumping to <code>2018-02-01</code> and then, on the next iteration,
  we'll hit the <code>Less</code> branch to end up on <code>2018-02-12</code>.
  Somewhat inefficient, but legal.
</p>

<note>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      gotcha, you didn't think about non-existent days such as 2018-02-31 !!!
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    <i>*fixes bowtie*</i> well actually such days will work correctly, but also
    somewhat inefficient, e.g.:
  </p>

  <listing lang="rust">
    <!--
    Rule::DayOfMonth(31)
        .next(date("2018-02-14"))
    -->
  </listing>

  <p>
    ... will say <code>2018-03-03</code> - which is legal, because the actual
    next occurrence happens on <code>2018-03-31</code>, for which
    <code>2018-03-03</code> is a valid underapproximation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that ideally our function <i>would</i> return <code>2018-03-31</code>,
    but it doesn't have to.
  </p>
</note>

<p>
  Ok, we've got <code>day-of-week</code>, we've got <code>day-of-month</code> -
  time for conditionals!

  There are two types of boolean operators we need to support, <code>or</code>

<note>
  <p>
    Intuitively - if <code>(day-of-week Friday 2018-01-01)</code> returns
    <code>2018-01-05</code>, then it will say the same when asked from
    <code>2018-01-01</code> up to and including <code>2018-01-05</code>:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>(day-of-week Friday 2018-01-01) = 2018-01-05</code>

  This means that <code>f(x) or g(x)</code> corresponds to

  This boils down to the following cute snippet:

<p>
  Conversely, <code>and = max</code>, for a similar reason: if <code>f(x)</code>
  says it won't be valid until some date <code>A</code> and <code>g(x)</code>
  says it won't be valid until some date <code>B</code>, then both won't be
  valid until at least <code>max(A, B)</code>.

<p>
  This doesn't necessarily mean that both rules <i>are</i> valid at
  <code>max(A, B)</code>, e.g.:

  <p>
    If we start on <code>2018-01-01</code>, then converging to

<p>
  Now, I could go on and implement all of the other parameters, but for the most
  part they follow the outline showed here, nothing fancy - so instead let's
  wrap up by implementing the parameters that require a bit different approach,
  <code>FREQ</code> and <code>INTERVAL</code>.
</p>

<p>
  The simplest case is the default of <code>INTERVAL=1</code> - it feels quite
  intuitive, but what does it really mean?
</p>

<p>
  Let's analyze a specific example:
</p>

<listing-title>
  FREQ=MONTHLY;INTERVAL=1;DTSTART=20180114
</listing-title>

<listing lang="text">
  <!--
  -> 2018-01-14
  -> 2018-02-14
  -> 2018-03-14
  -> 2018-04-14
  -> [...]
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  What's the pattern? Perhaps surprisingly, we can already encode it - that's
  just <code>(day-of-month 14)</code>!
</p>

<p>
  This means that <code>FREQ=MONTHLY;INTERVAL=1;DTSTART=201801014</code> is
  really <code>BYMONTHDAY=14;DTSTART=20180114</code> - and actually all forms of
  <code>FREQ=;INTERVAL=1</code> can be reduced to some combination of the
  <code>BY*</code> rules:
</p>

<listing lang="text">
  <!--
  FREQ=YEARLY;INTERVAL=1;DTSTART=20180114
  -> BYMONTH=1;BYMONTHDAY=14
  -> (and (month 1) (day-of-month 14))
  -->
</listing>

<listing lang="text">
  <!--
  FREQ=MONTHLY;INTERVAL=1;DTSTART=20180114
  -> BYMONTHDAY=14
  -> (day-of-month 14)
  -->
</listing>

<listing lang="text">
  <!--
  FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=1;DTSTART=20180114
  -> BYDAY=SU
  -> (weekday Sunday)
  -->
</listing>

<listing lang="text">
  <!--
  FREQ=DAILY;INTERVAL=1;DTSTART=20180114
  -> no-op
  -->
</listing>

<note>
  <p>
    Introducing time requires extending this logic, like:
  </p>

  <listing lang="text">
    <!--
    FREQ=MONTHLY;INTERVAL=1;DTSTART=20180114T123456
    -> BYMONTHDAY=14;BYHOUR=12;BYMINUTE=34;BYSECOND=56
    -> (and (day-of-month 14) (hour 12) (minute 34) (second 56))
    -->
  </listing>

  <p>
    This is addressed by the standard right here:
  </p>

  <listing lang="text">
    <!--
    Information, not contained in the rule, necessary to determine the
    various recurrence instance start time and dates are derived from
    the Start Time ("DTSTART") component attribute.  For example,
    "FREQ=YEARLY;BYMONTH=1" doesn't specify a specific day within the
    month or a time.  This information would be the same as what is
    specified for "DTSTART".
    -->
  </listing>

  <p>
    ... with one hidden caveat, time zone transitions (daylight saving time) -
    standard says that:
  </p>

  <listing lang="text">
    <!--
    Recurrence rules may generate recurrence instances with an invalid
    date (e.g., February 30) or nonexistent local time (e.g., 1:30 AM
    on a day where the local time is moved forward by an hour at 1:00
    AM).  Such recurrence instances MUST be ignored and MUST NOT be
    counted as part of the recurrence set.
    -->
  </listing>

  <p>
    ... but I'm pretty sure this doesn't affect the cases where
    <code>DTSTART</code>'s time lands on a daylight saving time switch. Let me
    show you a specific example.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the Europe/Warsaw time zone, on 2025-03-30 clocks are adjusted forward
    from 02:00:00 (winter time) to 03:00:00 (summer time) - this means that e.g.
    02:30:00 local time doesn't exist.
  </p>

  <p>
    If <code>DTSTART</code>'s time happens to land there, some implementations
    actually snap the time forward:
  </p>

  <listing-title>
    FREQ=DAILY;INTERVAL=1;DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Warsaw=20250329T023000
  </listing-title>

  <listing lang="text">
    <!--
    -> 2025-03-29 02:30:00
    -> 2025-03-30 03:30:00 [!!]
    -> 2025-03-31 02:30:00
    -->
  </listing>

  <p>
    At the same time, the <code>BYHOUR</code> rule must work on a
    literal-comparison basis, so if we'd like to reproduce this behavior, we'd
    have to distinguish between literal and observed time.
  </p>
</note>

<p>
  What about intervals larger than one? Once again, let's take an example:
</p>

<listing-title>
  FREQ=MONTHLY;INTERVAL=5;DTSTART=20180114
</listing-title>

<listing lang="text">
  <!--
  -> 2018-01-14
  -> 2018-06-14
  -> 2018-11-14
  -> 2019-04-14
  -> [...]
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  ... or two, to have a complete picture:
</p>

<listing-title>
  FREQ=MONTHLY;INTERVAL=5;BYDAY=MO,TU;DTSTART=20180114
</listing-title>

<listing lang="text">
  <!--
  -> 2018-01-15
  -> 2018-01-16
  -> 2018-01-22
  -> 2018-01-23
  -> 2018-01-29
  -> 2018-01-30
  -> 2018-06-04
  -> 2018-06-05
  -> [...]
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  Alright, what's the pattern? Looking at the first example suggests:
</p>

<listing lang="text">
  <!--
  date = DTSTART + FREQ * INTERVAL * nth

  -> 2018-01-14 = 2018-01-14 + 5 months * 0
  -> 2018-06-14 = 2018-01-14 + 5 months * 1
  -> 2018-11-14 = 2018-01-14 + 5 months * 2
  -> 2019-04-14 = 2018-01-14 + 5 months * 3
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  ... but this falls apart over the second example where none of the dates are
  an exact repetition:
</p>

<listing lang="text">
  <!--
  -> 2018-01-15 = 2018-01-14 + 1 day
  -> 2018-01-16 = 2018-01-14 + 2 days
  -> [...]
  -> 2018-06-04 = 2018-01-14 + 4 months and 21 days
  -> 2018-06-05 = 2018-01-14 + 4 months and 22 days
  -> [...]
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  In fact, <code>2018-06-04</code> isn't even 5 months apart from
  <code>2018-01-14</code>!
</p>

<p>
  If we're not literally repeating the starting date, then what's going on?
  Let's compare a correct and an incorrect occurrence, following the second
  example and ignoring <code>BYDAY=MO,TU</code> for a moment:
</p>

<listing lang="text">
  <!--
  correct:
  -> 2018-06-04 = 2018-01-14 + 4 months and 21 days

  incorrect:
  -> 2018-05-31 = 2018-01-14 + 4 months and 17 days
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  Clearly we're doing something wrong by looking  the distance between
  <code>DTSTART</code> and our candidate. In particular, we can see that
  <code>DTSTART</code>'s day part doesn't affect anything, except for in the
  first month.
</p>

<p>
  That is, if we started on <code>DTSTART=20180120</code>, we'd still go through
  <code>2018-06-04</code>, even though the distance between those two just got
  shorter - so for <code>FREQ=MONTHLY</code> we should have a way of comparing
  dates that ignores the day part.
</p>

<p>
  One approach could be:
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
  fn months_of(date: Date) -> i16 {
      date.year() * 12 + date.month()
  }

  fn months_between(lhs: Date, rhs: Date) -> i16 {
       months_of(lhs) - months_of(rhs)
  }

  // ... and then we make sure that months_between() is divisible by INTERVAL
  -->
</listing>

<p>
  ... but Jiff's spans are more convenient to work with, and they generalize to
  other units as well:
</p>

<listing lang="rust">
  <!--
  /* ... */
  use jiff::{SpanRound, Unit};

                  // By default `.since()` returns span in days - for proper

  Closing thoughts

<h3>
  Isn't it too complex?
</h3>

<p>
  I'd argue that this distance-based approach is actually <i>simpler</i> than
  what other implementations do.
</p>

<p>
  That's because at every step you have something that's easy to reason about in
  isolation - you have one function that rounds date to the next week, you have
  another function that takes two values and returns the smallest one etc., and
  all of those functions make sense on their own.
</p>

<p>
  Not to mention that fast-forwarding - "find me the next occurrence after xxx"
  - is something that other implementations struggle with, while in this case
  you get it for free.
</p>

<h3>
  Isn't it too slow?
</h3>

<p>
  Seems to be okay - I've benchmarked my reasonably optimized implementation
  (closed source for the time being) and iterating hundreds of times over
  complex rules happens under a millisecond.
</p>

<p>
  The beauty of going distancefunctioned™ is that you can optimize as much or
  as little as you want - after all, half of this article is actually spent
  talking about optimization.
</p>

<h3>
  Surely you can't be the first one to come up with this?
</h3>

<p>
  I hope I'm not the first one! I couldn't find any existing implementation
  that works this way, though.
</p>

<p>
  The mathematical foundation also escapes me - surely this must've been already
  discovered in one form or another, but I haven't found anything this specific.
