    Hi, I'm Patryk - a software developer who likes to throw algorithms at stuff
    and see what happens.

  <p>
    I work as a Senior Rust Developer at
    <a href="https://fudosecurity.com">Fudo Security</a>; I'm a fan of Rust, Nix
    and Emacs; in my spare time I'm working on
    <a href="https://github.com/Patryk27/kartoffels">kartoffels</a>, improving
    AVR support in Rust and committing to nixpkgs.
