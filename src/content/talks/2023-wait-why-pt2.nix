      Even though Rust strives for simplicity, it's got a couple of surprising
      corners and edge cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this talk I'm going to show you what makes <code>impl Drop</code>
      super-special, what's the difference between using <code>Self</code>
      and the type's name, what's the deal with <code>#[derive]</code> and
      trait bounds, and many others things that I've stumbled upon.
