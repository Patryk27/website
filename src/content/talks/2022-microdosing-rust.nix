  description = ''
    <p>
      AVRs are charming microcontrollers which can survive more than 300 days
      on a single AA battery, lying on anything - from cold ice to sizzling
      stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      They can communicate with both high-level machines such as computers
      and low-level peripherals like humidity meters, which makes them neat,
      satisfying MCUs to play with -- and they can be programmed in Rust!
