    <p>
      Since I spent most of my days looking at a text editor, I've had the
      chance of going through lots of programs, plugins, IDEs and ideas - some
      better, some worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this talk I'm going to show you what I've learned and how a typical
      day in my editor looks like. I'll also show you lots of tricks that make
      working with code, Git and filesystem easier, less error-prone and
      more comfortable.
