Graphviz is a software that renders graphs, Factorio is a game in which you build and maintain factories; let's explore
how both can complement each other.

[NOTE]
====
I assume you know a bit about Factorio and, as for the rest of concepts, I'll introduce you to them as we go. If you
haven't played Factorio yet, I highly encourage you to give it a try!

== Case study: Logistic science pack

The story goes: we've started the game, built a few mining drills (particularly for coal, iron, and copper), and got a
basic electrical grid set up - *time for science!*

Certainly, we need a handful of laboratories:

image::/resources/factorio-graphviz-pt1/factorio-laboratories.jpg[]

For our laboratories to work, we need a production line that will provide a constant flow of science packs; since
automation science packs are turbo-easy to produce, let's ignore them and focus right-away on
https://wiki.factorio.com/Logistic_science_pack[logistic science packs].

As we can find on Factorio's Wiki:

- To produce `1 logistic science pack`, we'll need `1 inserter` and `1 transport belt`.

- Before though, to produce that `1 inserter`, we'll need `1 electronic circuit`, `1 iron gear wheel`, and
`1 iron plate`.

- Before though, to produce _that_ `1 electronic circuit`, we'll need... well, describing this in English gets tedious;
what do you say we invent some notation to make the our recipe just a tad more legible?

Let's start with a minimalistic textual format of:

----
product
    requirements
----

_Oh, thinking about all the stuff we can do with this grammar-boi gives me shivers running down my spine!_

Translating the former ingredients, we get:

----
logistic_science_pack
    inserter
    transport_belt
----

Since both `inserter` and `transport_belt` need to be produced too, let's include them as well:

----
logistic_science_pack
    inserter
    transport_belt

inserter
    electronic_circuit
    iron_gear_wheel
    iron_plate

transport_belt
    iron_gear_wheel
    iron_plate
----

Similarly, we'll need to produce `electronic_circuit`, `iron_gear_wheel`, and - generally - everything that's not
primitive (which in my case means that I'll need to produce everything up to `iron_plate` and `copper_plate`):

----
logistic_science_pack
    inserter
    transport_belt

inserter
    electronic_circuit
    iron_gear_wheel
    iron_plate

transport_belt
    iron_gear_wheel
    iron_plate

electronic_circuit
    copper_cable
    iron_plate

copper_cable
    copper_plate

iron_gear_wheel
    iron_plate
----

[NOTE]
====
Some people like to build https://wiki.factorio.com/Tutorial:Main_bus[main buses] with different constituents - if you
have an abundance of e.g. iron gear wheels, feel free to skip them from the recipe.
====

This was the first step.

So far, we've gathered all the knowledge about what needs to be fetched (think: copper plates) and what needs to be
built (think: iron gear wheels) - our original problem remains open though: *where to place those assembly machines?*

That's when graphs come into play.

== Introduction to graphs

Graphs are structures used to model *relationships* between objects - using graphs you can represent things like family
trees or networks of friends:

[graphviz, format=svg, opts=inline]
----
graph {
    rankdir = "LR"

    Patryk -- Dafne
    Dafne -- Niko
    Dafne -- Dulcia
    Dulcia -- Charlie
}
----

Graphs consist of *nodes* (`Patryk`, `Dafne` etc. on the image above) and *edges* (the lines connecting nodes).

Graphs can be *undirected* (like the one above) or *directed*:

[graphviz, format=svg, opts=inline]
----
digraph {
    rankdir = "LR"

    Patryk -> Dafne
    Dafne -> Patryk

    Dafne -> Niko
    Dafne -> Dulcia
    Dulcia -> Charlie
}
----

Graphs can be *rendered by computers* (like the one above) or, obviously, *by hand*:

image::/resources/factorio-graphviz-pt1/hand-drawn-graph.svg[width = 40%]

Since this post is all about automating stuff, we're going to focus solely on the computer-generated graphs - using
https://www.graphviz.org[Graphviz].

Graphviz is a software that transforms description of a graph (written in the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)[DOT language]) into an image; for instance, here's
source code of the directed graph you saw above:

[source, dot]
----
# This instruction starts a directed graph
digraph {
    # This instruction makes the graph go left-to-right
    rankdir = "LR"

    # Those instructions define nodes and edges ("connections")
    Patryk -> Dafne
    Dafne -> Patryk
    Dafne -> Niko
    Dafne -> Dulcia
    Dulcia -> Charlie
}
----

[NOTE]
====
There are lots of fantastic *online* tools you can use to preview graphs written in the DOT language; I frequently use
https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline and https://rsms.me/graphviz/.

You can just open the page, copy & paste graph's code and get a nice image in return.
====

What's peculiar about the DOT language, and what we're going to exploit in a second, is the fact that we don't have to
specify *where* our nodes and edges should be located - we just say `Patryk -> Dafne`, `Dafne -> Niko` and the program,
almost magically, *lays out* everything for us in an aesthetically-pleasant way.

Let's see how we can use this feature to answer the problem we had in the previous section.

[NOTE]
====
The overall subject of pretty-printing graphs is called
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing[force-directed graph drawing] - it's a nice rabbit hole to go
down for a side programming project!

== Case study: Logistic science pack (cont.)

Let's recall our recipe:

----
logistic_science_pack
    inserter
    transport_belt

inserter
    electronic_circuit
    iron_gear_wheel
    iron_plate

transport_belt
    iron_gear_wheel
    iron_plate

electronic_circuit
    copper_cable
    iron_plate

copper_cable
    copper_plate

iron_gear_wheel
    iron_plate
----

Since Graphviz doesn't understand our notation (we've just invented it, right?), first we have to translate it into the
DOT language.

Let's start with `logistic_science_pack`:

{{% col-graph expander=false %}}
{{< col-graph-src collapsed=true expanded=true rendered=true >}}
----
digraph {
    inserter -> logistic_science_pack
    transport_belt -> logistic_science_pack
}
----
{{< /col-graph-src >}}
{{% /col-graph %}}

Now it's time for `inserter` and `transport_belt`:

{{% col-graph expander=false %}}
{{< col-graph-src collapsed=true expanded=true >}}
----
digraph {
    inserter -> logistic_science_pack
    transport_belt -> logistic_science_pack

    electronic_circuit -> inserter
    iron_gear_wheel -> inserter
    iron_plate -> inserter

    iron_gear_wheel -> transport_belt
    iron_plate -> transport_belt
}
----
{{< /col-graph-src >}}

{{< col-graph-src rendered=true >}}
----
digraph {
    inserter -> logistic_science_pack
    transport_belt -> logistic_science_pack

    electronic_circuit -> inserter
    iron_gear_wheel -> inserter
    iron_plate -> inserter

    iron_gear_wheel -> transport_belt
    iron_plate -> transport_belt

    # To fix a positioning issue
    iron_plate -> electronic_circuit [style=invis]
}
----
{{< /col-graph-src >}}
{{% /col-graph %}}

And so on, and so forth, until we finally end up with:

{{% col-graph expander=false %}}
{{< col-graph-src collapsed=true expanded=true rendered=true >}}
----
digraph {
    inserter -> logistic_science_pack
    transport_belt -> logistic_science_pack

    electronic_circuit -> inserter
    iron_gear_wheel -> inserter
    iron_plate -> inserter

    iron_gear_wheel -> transport_belt
    iron_plate -> transport_belt

    copper_cable -> electronic_circuit
    iron_plate -> electronic_circuit

    copper_plate -> copper_cable

    iron_plate -> iron_gear_wheel
}
----
{{< /col-graph-src >}}
{{% /col-graph %}}

Neat, we've finally extracted some _new_ information from the system: *placement* and *wiring*!

Granted, it's not perfect (fat chance those curvy transport belts would actually work in the game), but it's a nice
starting point - now let's try to improve it.

Since transport belts must be straight, let's start by forcing the edges to be in line via `splines = ortho`:

{{% col-graph expander=true %}}
{{< col-graph-src collapsed=true >}}
----
digraph {
    splines = ortho

    /* ... */
}
----
{{< /col-graph-src >}}

{{< col-graph-src expanded=true rendered=true >}}
----
digraph {
    splines = ortho

    inserter -> logistic_science_pack
    transport_belt -> logistic_science_pack
    electronic_circuit -> inserter
    iron_gear_wheel -> inserter
    iron_plate -> inserter
    iron_gear_wheel -> transport_belt
    iron_plate -> transport_belt
    copper_cable -> electronic_circuit
    iron_plate -> electronic_circuit
    copper_plate -> copper_cable
    iron_plate -> iron_gear_wheel
}
----
{{< /col-graph-src >}}
{{% /col-graph %}}

[NOTE]
====
There are many other spline algorithms you can experiment with - you can find them all in the
https://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html#d:splines[documentation].
====

It looks somewhat better, but still kinda sloppy.

Since in my factory I'm going to transport copper plates next to iron plates, it will be helpful to align
`copper_plate` on the same level as `iron_plate` (since both will effectively function as "inputs" to our module).

To align nodes, we can use the `rank` instruction:

{{% col-graph expander=true %}}
{{< col-graph-src collapsed=true >}}
----
digraph {
    /* ... */

    {
        # This instruction tells Graphviz
        # to align all nodes located in
        # this block next to each other
        rank = same

        copper_plate
        iron_plate
    }

    /* ... */
}
----
{{< /col-graph-src >}}

{{< col-graph-src expanded=true rendered=true >}}
----
digraph {
    splines = ortho

    {
        rank = same

        copper_plate
        iron_plate
    }

    inserter -> logistic_science_pack
    transport_belt -> logistic_science_pack
    electronic_circuit -> inserter
    iron_gear_wheel -> inserter
    iron_plate -> inserter
    iron_gear_wheel -> transport_belt
    iron_plate -> transport_belt
    copper_cable -> electronic_circuit
    iron_plate -> electronic_circuit
    copper_plate -> copper_cable
    iron_plate -> iron_gear_wheel
}
----
{{< /col-graph-src >}}
{{% /col-graph %}}

Well, our new layout is both technically correct and a bit disappointing - even though we've managed to get
`copper_plate` and `iron_plate` on the same level, we've also ended up with two crossing edges (next to
`transport_belt`), which is a no-go for such a small module.

Let's help Graphviz by additionally aligning `inserter` and `transport_belt` on the same level:

{{% col-graph expander=true %}}
{{< col-graph-src collapsed=true >}}
----
digraph {
    /* ... */

    {
        rank = same

        inserter
        transport_belt
    }

    /* ... */
}
----
{{< /col-graph-src >}}

{{< col-graph-src expanded=true rendered=true >}}
----
digraph {
    splines = ortho

    {
        rank = same

        copper_plate
        iron_plate
    }

    {
        rank = same

        inserter
        transport_belt
    }

    copper_plate -> copper_cable
    copper_cable -> electronic_circuit
    iron_plate -> electronic_circuit
    electronic_circuit -> inserter
    iron_gear_wheel -> inserter
    iron_plate -> inserter
    iron_plate -> iron_gear_wheel
    inserter -> logistic_science_pack
    transport_belt -> logistic_science_pack
    iron_gear_wheel -> transport_belt
    iron_plate -> transport_belt
}
----
{{< /col-graph-src >}}
{{% /col-graph %}}

I'd say

{{< meme not-great-not-terrible >}}

\... at least this time we've got something we could _actually build_ in the game!

No reason to rest on our laurels so soon though - since Factorio's assembly machines are squares, it would make sense to
make our appropriate nodes look like squares too:

{{% col-graph expander=true %}}
{{< col-graph-src collapsed=true >}}
----
digraph {
    /* ... */

    copper_cable [shape = box]
    electronic_circuit [shape = box]

    /* ... */
}
----
{{< /col-graph-src >}}

{{< col-graph-src expanded=true rendered=true >}}
----
digraph {
    splines = ortho

    {
        rank = same

        copper_plate
        iron_plate
    }

    {
        rank = same

        inserter
        transport_belt
    }

    copper_cable [shape = box]
    electronic_circuit [shape = box]
    iron_gear_wheel [shape = box]
    inserter [shape = box]
    transport_belt [shape = box]
    logistic_science_pack [shape = box]

    copper_plate -> copper_cable
    copper_cable -> electronic_circuit
    iron_plate -> electronic_circuit
    electronic_circuit -> inserter
    iron_gear_wheel -> inserter
    iron_plate -> inserter
    iron_plate -> iron_gear_wheel
    inserter -> logistic_science_pack
    transport_belt -> logistic_science_pack
    iron_gear_wheel -> transport_belt
    iron_plate -> transport_belt
}
----
{{< /col-graph-src >}}
{{% /col-graph %}}

Seizing the day, let's make them all of the same size as well:

{{% col-graph expander=true %}}
{{< col-graph-src collapsed=true >}}
----
digraph {
    /* ... */

    copper_cable [
        shape = box,
        width = 1.5,
        height = 1.5,
        fixedsize = true
    ]

    electronic_circuit [
        shape = box,
        width = 1.5,
        height = 1.5,
        fixedsize = true
    ]

    /* ... */
}
----
{{< /col-graph-src >}}

        rank = same

        iron_plate

    {
        rank = same

        inserter
        transport_belt
    }

    copper_cable [
        shape = box,
        width = 1.5,
        height = 1.5,
        fixedsize = true
    ]

    electronic_circuit [
        shape = box,
        width = 1.5,
        height = 1.5,
        fixedsize = true
    ]

    iron_gear_wheel [

        width = 1.5,
        height = 1.5,
        fixedsize = true
    ]

    inserter [
        shape = box,
        width = 1.5,
        height = 1.5,
        fixedsize = true
    ]

    iron_plate -> transport_belt
}
----
{{< /col-graph-src >}}
{{% /col-graph %}}

Not sure about you, but I am *in awe* seeing how well Graphviz managed to lay our graph out - we could reconstruct it
almost 1:1 in the game!

There's just one itsy-bitsy tiny thing we may still iterate on:

Do you see that `iron_gear_wheel` near the centre?

Currently it's responsible for producing wheels both for `transport_belt` and `inserter`, which means we'd have to
apply a splitter - this seems overly troublesome by my standards, so let's just create two separate assembly machines
instead:

{{% col-graph expander=true %}}
{{< col-graph-src collapsed=true >}}
----
digraph {
    /* ... */

    iron_plate -> iron_gear_wheel_1
    iron_gear_wheel_1 -> inserter

    iron_plate -> iron_gear_wheel_2
    iron_gear_wheel_2 -> transport_belt

    /* ... */
}
----
{{< /col-graph-src >}}

{{< col-graph-src expanded=true rendered=true >}}
----
digraph {
    splines = ortho

    {
        rank = same

        copper_plate
        iron_plate
    }

    {
        rank = same

        inserter
        transport_belt
    }

    copper_cable [
        shape = box,
        width = 1.5,
        height = 1.5,
        fixedsize = true
    ]

    electronic_circuit [
        shape = box,
        width = 1.5,
        height = 1.5,
        fixedsize = true
    ]

    iron_gear_wheel_1 [
        shape = box,
        width = 1.5,
        height = 1.5,
        fixedsize = true
    ]

    iron_gear_wheel_2 [
        shape = box,
        width = 1.5,
        height = 1.5,
        fixedsize = true
    ]

    inserter [
        shape = box,
        width = 1.5,
        height = 1.5,
        fixedsize = true
    ]

    transport_belt [
        shape = box,
        width = 1.5,

Seems like we've made it - this our our toy at work:

video::/resources/factorio-graphviz-pt1/factorio-finished.webm[]

The first potion gets produced at 0:25, which is a rather long time, but - even so - *it's a success*!

Now, there's a vast array of things we could still work on - mainly:

Up to this point we didn't really care about _how long_ it takes to produce each part - and so at 0:33 we can see that
everything gets bottle-necked at the final, `logistic_science_pack` assembly machine.

Solving this issue is left as an exercise for the reader :-)

== Case study: Chemical science pack

This one is actually going to be way shorter - let's skip all the ceremony and jump straight into the recipe:

----
chemical_science_pack
    advanced_circuit
    engine_unit
    sulfur

advanced_circuit
    copper_cable
    electronic_circuit
    plastic_bar

copper_cable
    copper_plate

electronic_circuit
    copper_cable
    iron_plate

plastic_bar
    coal
    petroleum_gas

engine_unit
    iron_gear_wheel
    pipe
    steel_plate

iron_gear_wheel
    iron_plate

pipe
    iron_plate

steel_plate
    iron_plate

sulfur
    petroleum_gas
    water
----

Since I don't quite enjoy arduous, repetitive tasks - and I'm a programmer by heart - instead of translating the entire
recipe by hand, I've prepared a tiny application that can do it for me; it's available at
https://factorio-layouter.pwychowaniec.com - feel free to use it!

== Summary & future work

As with everything, so doesn't using Graphviz solve all our problems.

I find it helpful in planning the *initial sketches* of various modules (which I later reiterate on a piece of paper
before eventually reconstructing in Factorio), and that's why I wanted to share this method with you.

In the following post I'm going to describe how I created that simple `factorio-layouter` application - it will be a
purely technical article where we'll take a look at parser combinators, Rust, WebAssembly, and a few other things I've
molded together.
